My Fatty Ramen dish was a bit tastier since the <p>broth</p> was a little bit <n>thicker</n> and almost <n>creamy</n>. The pork belly was wonderfully tender with crispness on the outside that really added a nice texture when combined with the <p>noodles</p>. I wish they would have separated the <p>bok choi</p> rather than keeping it in tact within the dish. It was a bit awkward trying to separate the leaves so I could have just one leaf with each bite of noodles. The veggie ramen dish was ordered with <p>fried garlic</p> which added a wonderful flavor.

3.1,"Bar Takito is a sister restaurant to Takito Kitchen in Wicker Park. Located right beside the Morgan el stop in the West Loop, Bar Takito has a large sidewalk patio seating area, and a spacious interior with two bars. The space is bright and colorful and has lots of seating.The menu features <n>Mexican</n>, <n>Central</n>, and <n>South American</n> food with a modern twist. This isn’t the type of place that serves guacamole. Instead they specialize in more unique offerings inspired by seasonal ingredients.We started with the Chorizo & Chicken Arepa. An arepa is a corn pancake, and at Bar Takito it has whole kernels of corn. It was then topped with <p>mushrooms</p>, <p>pickled vegetables</p>, <p>chorizo</p>, <p>chicken</p>, and an <p>aji peanut sauce</p>.The chicken was <n>fried</n> in large pieces, while the <p>chorizo</p> was finely <n>chopped</n>. I really enjoyed the <p>arepa</p> and the sauce, but I think that there was a little too much going on here. Next time I would order the <p>Vegetarian Arepa</p> instead.Next up, two orders of <p>tacos</p>. Takito is known for it’s tacos and they lived up to the hype. The menu includes four different types of tacos, which are served in orders of three. We chose to try the <p>Brunkow Cheese</p> and <p>Coffee Braised Beef tacos</p>.The <p>Brunkow Cheese Tacos</p> came with a large piece of <p>grilled brunkow cheese</p>, <p>pickled jicama</p>, <p>arugula</p>, <p>peanuts</p>, <p>ahi peanut sauce</p>, and a slice of avocado. The cheese was <n>warm</n> and <n>soft</n> and <n>thick</n>, yet not <n>melted</n>. The texture was great, and the flavor pairing the the <p>peanut sauce</p> and the avocado was <n>fresh tasting</n> and delicious.                                thekittchen.com,",Bar Takito,Chicago

4.3,"I have seen this restaurant many times while walking downtown Naperville. It looked <n>quiet</n>, <n>quaint</n>, and <n>pretty</n>. I was taking my adopted"," mom for her birthday lunch in Naperville, so I suggested this place. She agreed and off we went!They placed us by the window and it was perfect. The ambience by the window was so pretty as we looked outside and got ray of sunshine on us. It was nice. They gave us a dinner menu by mistake and while we were deciding, they switched our menu to a lunch menu. We could still get the dinner stuff if we wanted to. My mom already had her heart set on a <p>dinner pasta</p>. I started to flip and flop. I ended up getting a <p>meatball sandwich</p> from the lunch menu while at first I wanted a <p>chicken dish</p>.We also ordered <p>calamari</p> for <p>appetizer</p>. It was really really good. It looked pale with very <n>thin</n> <n>breading</n>. However, when you ate them... So good! They're <n>super tender</n>, <n>flavorful</n>, <n>humongous</n>! They gave you a lot of <n>gigantic</n> <n>tentacles</n>! Mom and I were kinda fighting for it tho there were plenty. They were so delicious!Her <p>spaghetti</p> came in <p>red sauce</p> with shrimps and <p>scallops</p> and other seafood. The shrimps were <n>huge</n> as well and mom was just enjoying her lunch so much. It was a really <n>big</n> portion and she barely made a dent. She'd be eating that for <n>dinner</n>, <n>lunch</n>, and another dinner.My meatball sandwich was a good size too and they filled the bread with three meatballs. I ate one and half meatballs and was done. The meatballs have great taste but it was too <n>salty</n> for me. The bread also got too <n>soggy</n> to be able to be picked up.Service was great and <n>attentive</n>. A couple of complaints, they kept refilling my <p>ice tea</p> by pitcher, and it was just pure <p>tea</p> and no <p>ice</p>. By the third cup, I had no ice either in my glass. Then, it was just tea, not <p>iced tea</p>. The second one was we had <n>lunch</n> rather early and the whole place was open. They placed a guy to sit by us though there were so many other open spaces. The guy sat so close to us on that <n>tiny</n> nook. It was fun before for me and mom to be able to talk freely and now we had one guy just sitting by us. Lol. No offense, guy. However, a little privacy was preferred.

One of the original highways across America, Route 66 ran from downtown Chicago to the Pacific Ocean at Santa Monica, CA, a total of nearly 2500 miles. It’s also been referred to as “America’s Main Street,” and the “Mother Road.” The highway was instrumental in boosting America’s migration to the west by automobile, and was full of interesting tourist stops, eateries and motels with creative architecture.

3.7,"Beware the valet service at Pegasus!I had the misfortune of dining at Pegasus a few months ago.  The food was <n>unremarkable</n> and we regretted not choosing Greek Islands across the street as we usually do when in town, but the worst part came as we were driving home and discovered several items missing from the car after using their valet!  I called the restaurant but didn't get anywhere.  Eventually I decided to forget about it since the items didn't amount to more than a couple hundred dollars in value - small amount of cash, umbrellas, car charger and cables, sunglasses, etc.I probably wouldn't have written this review, but after a neighbor heard my story, they told something interesting about their experience at Pegasus.  They had used the valet service and when they asked for the car back the attendant walked straight to the car without going to the key box.  Then the attendant opened the unlocked car and pulled the keys from under the mat!  Everything was in full view since the valet parking is just across the street from restaurant entrance.  My neighbor was shocked and fortunately didn't have anything in the car to be stolen, but how easy would it have been for someone to just take the car!I think something fishy is going on here.  If anyone else has had a similar experience please respond.Of course I understand that you have to be careful with any valet service, and I regret being foolish enough to have left some valuables in the car, but leaving cars unlocked with keys in them is just plain inexcusable.  Everyone I have told the story to wonders if the valet didn't have a partner going through the cars.  It's a perfect set up since the restaurant doesn't take responsibility for it.Also, we didn't discover our items missing until we had left Chicago, but if someone else finds items missing at the Pegasus valet, call the police immediately!  They need to know what is going on to make a record and investigate.  You'll probably never get your stuff back, but if enough attention is brought to the problem, maybe it can be prevented for others.,",Pegasus,Chicago

3.8,"Lack of flexibility is annoying. The food and service here were above average on my visit, but I have to complain about the inflexibility of this restaurant on their fixed-price menu. My husband is allergic to <p>fish</p> and shellfish and they flat-out refuse to make any changes to their set menu for people with food allergies (when we made the reservation we warned them about the issue). They claim that it is because some of the dishes on the menu, even those that aren't fish, are made with <p>stocks</p> and sauces that may contain fish elements. Ok - first of all, why are some of the <p>non-fish dishes</p> on the set menu made with <n>fishy</n> stocks and yet none of the non-fish dishes on the regular menu are made with these same ingredients? These seems a little odd. Second, I don't mean to get uppity here but I have dined in some of the nicest restaurants in the world (Fat Duck, French Laundry and Alinea for example) and never once have we been told that the chef could not change the menu to accommodate allergies. So my question is - why does the chef at North Pond, which by the way is nowhere in the same league as the restaurants mentioned above, refuse to make accommodations for diners who WANT to spend money at his establishment? There are a lot of people with legitimate allergies to food, are they really unwilling to make ANY provision for these people?,",North Pond,Chicago

3.7,"A smattering pricey for the portion sizes – from the wine pours to entrées - but we would certainly try them again, especially since they’re in our neighborhood (…but only after they fix the air conditioning.) We started off with cocktails, including the <p>Armeni-tini</p> ($11) a light and <n>refreshing</n> <p>pomegranate</p> and <p>vodka martini</p>, and the <p>Chili-Dilly</p> ($10), a tart and <n>mildly spicy</p> <p>chile vodka concoction</p>, served up with a huge sprig of <p>dill</p>. Certainly <p>craft drinks</p> worthy of the price.We started with the <p>Mezza Sampler</p>, which was delivered mere seconds after ordering. The long, three-sectioned plate featured labneh – a “<p>farmer’s cheese dip</p>”- which tasted like <n>plain</n> <p>cream cheese</p> with a <p>fruity olive oil drizzle</p> and a light dusting of <p>paprika</p>. There were two <n>ice-cold</n>, but <n>flavorful</n>, <p>yalanchi sarma</p> - <p>grape leaves</p> <n>stuffed</n> with <p>raisins</p>, <p>almonds</p> and <p>chopped herbs</p>. The trio was rounded out with a decent portion of <p>baba ghannouj</p>, the <n>famously</n> <n>roasted</n> <p>eggplant dip</p>, all served with a basket of <p>rocket-hot</p> <p>pita bread</p>. For $10.95, the offering was a decent way for two people to sample some of their traditional fare.The dining space itself is long and very (very) dark, with several small, semicircular cubby-holes that easily seat two, maybe three, with a third chair. On a recent Saturday night, the back of the room had been set up for a table of 20 when we arrive, but during our 90 minute meal, there were only about a dozen people in the restaurant. There were a few dining tables outside, and the bar can easily seat six to eight people. The bathrooms are down a steep flight of stairs, and were absolutely spotless. One thing we noticed half way through our dining was the temperature in the restaurant was rising rather quickly – despite being directly under an airduct, we could feel no air flowing. Some of the guests around us pointed out the room’s temperature to their waiters, and it sounded like the restaurant was having some problems with their air conditioning.  Feeling the heat, we opted for a glass of the <p>Armenian wine</p> ($9), a fresh and <n>fruity</n> pomegranate-based red, and a glass of one of their summer special <p>white wine</p>, a Pierre et Papa ($9) – sadly, the pours in the small <p>goblets</p> were rather miserly for the money.Much like the appetizers, our entrees arrived very quickly after ordering – the <p>shish kabobs</p> ($20.95) featured perfectly seared cubes of herbaceous lamb, cooked to exactly medium rare and sporting a nice, evenly charred crust. The flavors were spot-on, but the bed of white rice underneath was utterly flavorless. Our second entree, the Armenian Combo –was billed as “a generous serving of <p>sarma</p>, <p>boereg</p>, <p>kufta</p> and eggplant”, but was woefully lacking in generosity at $17.95. The three piece sarma (<p>stuffed grape leaves</p>) were stuffed with <p>minced meat</p> and spices, unfortunately they were covered in a rather tasteless, <n>cheese-like</n> sauce we couldn’t identify. The kufta, a lone, golf ball-sized meatball, was nicely flavored with spices and came swimming in a lemony cream sauce. The boereg was the only real stand out – a perfectly crispy filo-wrapped portion of spinach and cheese. The roasted eggplant was nothing more than a non-pureed version of their baba ghannouj. By now, it was rather stifling inside the restaurant due to the lack of airflow, so instead of ordering desserts and coffee, we opted for our check – just over $104.00, before tip.,",Sayat-Nova,All Reviews 20

The noodles in my curry chicken were <n>over-cooked</n>/<n>swollen</n>/<n>soggy</n>. The , of pho came in a bowl that was the size I normally eat cereal out of.

3.7,"Here is an Indian's perspective on this excellent meat house. Their Fillet Mignon with Garlic Mashed Potato is an excellent Medium-Rare cooked steak. Has a great taste and the tenderness of the meat is perfect. I personally do not recommend a tender steak with BBQ Sauce as the latter tends to overpower all other flavours. Visited with colleagues/friends in Sep and we decided to sit out as it was a sunny-bright day. Overall an excellent lunch time. A must try if you are fond of good meat!,",Weber Grill Restaurant,Chicago

3.7,"My husband and I LOVE Indian food! We always have to try out the best Indian food in the area whenever we are on vacation. I've been to Chicago a million times with my family and we always have to stop by Devon Ave. before going back. This time however, my husband and I just decided to walk around and just go into any restaurant that sounds good. We walked by Tiffin and decided to try it out.The ambiance of this restaurant is amazing! Its so beautifully designed and the layout of the place is wonderful! The place is super clean with no <n>overwhelming</n> smells! We walked in during lunch time on a Sunday and it wasn't too busy. My husband opted for the lunch buffet since it had <n>Lamb curry</n> and that's all he really wanted. I wanted the <n>Chicken Tikka Masala</n> and it wasn't included in the <n>buffet</n> so I ordered it off the menu. The staff was super great and attentive. Our waiter went to the back while I was waiting to give my order and the owner came over and asked if I needed anything. I asked him about the buffet and then asked when the waiter was coming back. He told me to just give him the order and he'll get it in and asked if I wanted a <p>coke</p> or <p>tea</p>. He even brought my plate and <p>drinks</p>! That definitely made an impression on my husband and I. The waiter himself also brought us <p>naan</p> numerous times and refilled our drinks quite often. I loved the service here. The food itself was SO GOOD!!!! My husband had 3 plates and my Chicken tikka masala was super Delicious! They also had some wonderful music playing. My husband recognized some of the songs and loved it. We will definitely recommend this place to all our family and friends and make sure they come here whenever they are in Chitown!  We can't wait to come back! Thanks Tiffin!!!,",Tiffin,Chicago

I was so impressed by the rose essence mini macarons. Wonderful wine and champagne selection.

4.4,The manager of this restaurant is extremely rude. I've eaten here countless times and have personally experienced his rude and unprofessional behavior. The last time took the cake. After being seated for my cousin's graduation we were rudely rushed along to order our food since it was a late reservation. We asked to speak with the manager to express our concerns for the waitress's poor attitude and he absolutely made matters far worse. After light debate he stated that he was refusing service, and asked us to leave. Clearly we were upset but on the way the way out we were farewelled by the very same waitress giving us the middle finger . I will never be returning.

The <p>dip</p> itself was delicious, but the <p>cracker</p> that the serve it with, left a lot to be desired. The cracker would break no matter how you tried to get dip on it. And as soon as it hit your mouth it dissolved. Tasty dip, but needs a vehicle change.My lunch date ordered the Shrimp BLT Sandwich with homemade chips. It was very underwhelming. There were MAYBE 2 shrimp on the sandwich and one slice of bacon. It was very plain and really, not worth it.I ordered the Grilled Beef Tenderloin Sandwich with <n>homemade</n> chips. I must say that this sandwich was wonderful. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium) and the whole sandwich was very flavorful and loaded with meat. Well worth the money they charge for it. The homemade chips, for both sandwiches, were slightly over- AND undercooked. But tasted fine. Will probably head back there, but not in the near future.,",Bijan's Bistro,Chicago

Once again all of the tables were full but we were glad to wait about 30 minutes for a table to clear. Once we were seated a whirlwind experience began. We picked the #1 ChaDol-Gui. We noticed the  menu stated it was a portion for 2 so we only ordered it plus a Mul Mandu appetizer. Normally we would order 2 items but I payed attention to the menu and other reviews advising not to order too much. It's a good thing because we had more than enough food for two. Every single thing we ate was good and I do not think we left anything behind. I also paid attention to the negative comments regarding the service and was ready for an abrasive server. Even on the night we were turned away we were politely told that they could not serve us. Even the 2 guys in front of us were told they could not get any take out food.

But being in Beverly, northsiders like Sam and I have never gotten the chance to try it without making a day out of it.  Luckily we were seeing a comedy show at the Hollywood casino amphitheatre in Tinley park so a quick side trip was in order.  So the deal is that they load up 5 different flavors on one cone for you to give you that patented rainbow look.  I don't know if it's the best ice cream in the world but the flavors went well together.  I never order sherbet so getting some orange was a pleasant surprise.  I'm still not sure what the Palmer house flavor was though.  The coolest part is that they have little cone holders with a little guard to catch any <n>melting</n> ice cream from getting to your hand.  It will happen.  There are a ton of other options like sundaes but we had to get the classic.  Rainbow cone is a must visit for any Chicago ice cream fanatic.

So far it was a wonderful experience, the only bad part was the owner/manager(not sure who she was, she alluded to owning the place in her conversation) spent half our meal with her butt in our face.  She apparently knew the couple at the next table well and got into a deep conversation with them about their daughter and her shared love of jumping horses with the couple. Yes she was close enough that I could have been included in the conversation as well.  I either could stare at my dinner partner or the kitchen, looking outside wasn't an option because she was standing right next to me, facing the couple, and have her conversation. It was only as we were getting our check that she decided to just sit down next to the couple, instead of standing next to me with her butt in my face.,",Mirai,Chicago

3.5,"The Chicago Diner has been meat free since '83. Other than the big sign on the back wall, there isn't really anything that makes it look too different than a regular restaurant...which is how I tricked the monkeys (Satchel, 14 and Jiro, 12) into eating there on our recent trip to Chicago. We'd been at the baseball game all day, and the monkeys were hungry. I told them I'd already found a place to eat close to our apartment. Once we regrouped, we walked over. It was close to 7:00pm when we got there and the hostess said it would be about a 30 minute wait. The monkeys moaned a bit, but I assured them that it would probably be closer to 15. (I had no way of knowing this, but I felt like it was a good thing to say.) I knew that having to wait would increase the buy in should the menu alert them to the fact that we were in a vegan establishment.

It seems a little suspect; they have an array of burgers, all with a ton of craaaaazy, wild shit on them, but the standout one, The Lockdown Warden, is all leeks and cheese. I_��m on board with that. I like leeks. Not to mention the cheese. Although the restaurant_��s website is full of a bunch of metal images and it_��s emblazoned with the Iron Maiden logo, I feel like if a restaurant is brave enough to do something with leeks on a burger, I should go.A cascade of Freddie Mercuries greet me on three televisions as I walk in. That_��s cool. Queen is something we can all agree on, correct? I like to think if I had started up a conversation about _��A Day at the Races_�� with those hard rock kids back in high school, our shoulders might have straightened a little and we might have had a decent conversation.And It_��s a beautiful burger. Lovely to gaze upon. Green, yellow fireworks topped with a <p>pretzel</p> bun. I_��m excited. I am the champion, my readers.But no. It_��s terrible. The meat is doughy. Meat_��s not a carbohydrate. Burger meat should not be doughy. I know, I know it_��s grass-fed beef. Yes, farm to table. But it doesn_��t taste right. And the <p>Merkts cheddar</p>, which has been stuffed inside the patty, squirts out the other end, onto the plate. Not in my mouth. I_��m left with a lot of leeks about as frazzled as I am, and a <n>doughy</n> burger. I scoop up the <p>cheese sauce</p> with my finger in an effort to save myself, but apparently it_��s children and men first because I_��ve not been saved with this action and I_��m drowning in regret.I want to like this burger. No one makes a burger with leeks. If there was a food draft, I_��d like to think that my tribe picked leeks, like, third. The flavor can evolve so deliciously drastically: coyly sweet but crisp one way, warm, mild and tender another. But bite after bite, the leeks seem to further dull the flavor in the rest of the dish. Maybe they were overfried. I had such high hopes once.I assume it_��s me. The burger was too hard rockin_�� for little _��The Shins made me cry once_�� me. Honestly, though, it felt as though the Warden burger was a Loggins and Messina production. Burgers or sandwiches piled high with a pound of crap, even if it_��s one ingredient of crap, was never my scene. I want to taste complexity in the meat. I want to taste the balance of cheese against that burger.thesandwichdamsel.com,",Lockdown Bar & Grill,Chicago
3.7,"We stopped in last night after work for drinks and appetizers. I was disappointed they haven't jumped on the Happy Hour train yet and they didn't have any specials.

My husband got the <p>Blueberry Vandermill Cider</p> and got a free State/Lake coosie with each can.For food we tried the Poutine, <p>Pimento Cheese Dip</p> with Chips, and Soft Pretzel with Red Pepper and Goat Cheese Dip. The Poutine came with bacon and peas and was super cheesy and delicious, not weighed down in gravy like Poutine can be. The <n>Pimento Dip<\n> was good, but far and away, the real winner was the pretzel with goat cheese and red pepper dip. It tasted like a jalapeͱo popper without being fried, and the pretzel was crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside. I don't usually like goat cheese, but I loved this. And the presentation of all the dishes was creative. The only downside was the service. Apparently we got caught in a shift change and had quite the time trying to track someone down to pay our bill (like 20+ minutes of waiting for someone give our money to).

They only filled half the compartment of the take out tray. The burrito was bland. It had no seasoning, no flavor, very little taste. There was no lettuce and very little tomatoes. I cannot recommend this dinner and will not go there again. Bottomline - overpriced and blah food.The restaurant would be a wonderful place for a date. It's very dark and cozy.

We walked in and it was seat yourself so we chose a table outside, though I wouldn't have minded inside either as it had a nice ambiance. My boyfriend and I decided to do a shared <n>plates</n>"," kind of meal even though that's not really the style of the restaurant. We started with the soft pretzel which was warm & fluffy (just the way it should be!). It was served with a chocolate stout mustard which complimented it really well. From there, we had the House Sausage Sampler. I'm not usually one to incorporate sausage into my meals, but these were so tasty I was completely satisfied. The sampler came with three types of sausage: Cuban with pickles and two types of mustard (my favorite of the sampler), Italian with marinara and giardiniera, and a duck/bacon sausage served over lettuce with aioli. All three were really good. For dessert we ordered ", which was basically s'mores with bourbon vanilla marshmallows enough for the two of us to split at the end of the meal. The overall experience was positive the wait staff attentive and a place I'd go back to!Also shout out to the group who came in as we were leaving and apologized for being rowdy ��- you weren't! You definitely made our great experience even greater by picking up our bill (I hope you see this!). Thank you!

We don't usually splurge on high end fine dining but thought this would be a great opportunity to test the waters.  Upon stepping in the door the service is phenomenal.  You're led to your <n>table</n> and you can see there's a brigade of servers floating around making sure your <p>water</p> is never less than half full and meticulously placing new silverware with each course.  Once you're settled the service starts and it is definitely an <n>experience</n>. The tasting menu had about 10 <n>courses</n> overall.  Each one was presented in a unique way.  If you're looking for big portions you may be disappointed but to be honest I was satisfied by the end.  I could describe everything but I'm sure the menu changes fairly often so here were the highlights. - Fried oyster <n>coated</n> in granola was something I didn't even know was a thing.  Plus they served it in the shells but those shells were placed in this planter filled with sticks and pebbles.  -The salmon was the most delicate piece of fish I've ever had. I don't even enjoy fish and it was cooked just rare so that it was flaky and amazing.  - <p>Clam chowder</p> that was prepared at the table. The soup was extremely delicate and my wife commented that this was one of the first times she really saw me trying to get every bit of soup onto my spoon.  I could go on but I will say they put a lot of effort into the presentation of each course.  The ascetic of modern fused with nature definitely comes through. You could even tell that the bowls and other serving ware were chosen because it seemed like they were molded with a woodsy pattern.  I'd give acadia a 4.5.euroatheart.com,",Acadia,Chicago

The past was significantly overcooked and fell apart on the fork. The sauce was somewhat flavorless. There were Bavarian style pretzels with excessive oregano and canned cheese for dipping. The spicy mustard was just odd-tasting. The buffalo wings were ok as were the corned beef sliders, (even though they weren't really sliders - just a quartered sandwich).  Add to that that a bottle of corona is $8 and I don't think we'll eat here again.,Kitty O'Shea's

2.9,"What a great addition to the <n>Buffalo</n> Grove area restaurant scene! I was really impressed that all of the food is made in- house. The <p>brats</p>, <p>soup</p> stocks and even the <p>whipped</p> <p>cream</p> on desserts are created from scratch in house and it's evident in their food! I had a chance to sample a lot of options on their menu at their soft opening and can tell you I'll be going back. They specialize in what they call Craft <p>American Fare</p>, which I interpreted as really delicious <n>American dishes</n> that have been amped up to a new flavor level with great ingredients and preparation. Besides the food, the atmosphere is what I really enjoyed. There is a very spacious bar with nice <n>screens</n> for game day, there are multiple private rooms for small groups and there is a fantastic <n>patio</n> with a <n>fire pit</n> and outdoor <n>heaters</n> for cool nights! #sponsor.

3.7,"Decadent and quick. Great place on the loop. I walked from Chicago Hilton to W. Washington on a whim to eat here. When I walked in the door, I knew the walk was worth the smell of <p>smoked meets</p> and <p>fresh</p> <p>bread</p>.,",Hannah's Bretzel,Chicago
3.6,"I like <n>Kitsch'n on Roscoe</n>. Well, I have two hours to kill as I wait to meet my son, so I had brunch at Kitsch’n on Roscoe in Chicago, and now you get the benefit of an incredibly detailed review of the one item that I ate!!I ordered the “<p>Candied Bacon Brunch BLT</p>”.Wow, it was delicious, and I recommend that you try it if you eat here.Here is the menu description: <p>Scrambled egg</p>, candied <p>apple-wood smoked bacon</p>, <p>tomato</p> and <p>romaine</p> on <p>butter-griddled Brioche</p> with <p>honey-mayo</p>, accompanied by Danish <p>hashbrowns</p>.Although the <p>bread</p> looks like ordinary white bread, it’s actually brioche baked into a <p>sandwich</p> <n>loaf</n> shape. “<n>Butter-grilled</n>” makes it soft, not crispy. Soft might also be a general feature of brioche, I’m not sure. I was satisfied with the soft texture, but normally I prefer crispy <p>toast</p> for a BLT. Keep that in mind if you, too, have a <n>crispy/soft</n> preference for BLT toast.The scrambled egg was delicious. Technically a “<n>folded egg</n>”, meaning I could see that it was cooked thinly and then folded over twice to give it a nice height and volume. I think that also makes a tidy <p>sandwich</p>, as chunks of scrambled egg don’t fall off the sandwich when you pick it up.There was a generous amount of <p>bacon</p>, delicious, and the sweetness was subtle, probably appropriate for a sweet/savory <p>sandwich</p> like this. It seemed like maybe it was <n>brushed</n> with <p>brown sugar</p> while frying, it was not thickly coated with a candied crust or anything.The tomato and romaine were generous, fresh and crisp.The <p>honey-mayo</p> was thin and subtly sweet, not heavy handed.Danish <p>hashbrowns</p> are awesome and delicious, I loved them. They are thick cubes of skin-on <p>potatoes</p>, prepared with purple <p>onions</p>, <p>red peppers</p> and lots of fresh <p>rosemary</p>. These are very strong flavored and well-seasoned, so again keep that in mind if you prefer traditional shredded <p>hashbrowns</p>, or breakfast <p>potatoes</p> that are milder.I’m here at 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon on a Wednesday, so the place is empty. But they can be quite busy during normal meal times.Kitsch’n on Roscoe is a “famous” restaurant that’s quite popular, it’s been featured on at least one television show, and has a great local reputation. The retro environment is wonderful. I suppose it’s an “intentionally kitschy” planned décor rather than “these genuine articles have been here for 50 years”, but it’s definitely comfy and charming.I had an awesomely friendly and competent server. I saw other reviews indicating that some servers here are not always so.When it comes to the price of restaurant food, I’ve totally lost perspective regarding what is “bargain”, “appropriate” or “overpriced”. Lately, to me, everything seems expensive!! The entrée I described was $9.50. That’s probably normal for this type of restaurant in Chicago’s Roscoe Village, Lakeview and Lincoln Park neighborhoods.,",Kitsch'n on Roscoe,Chicago
3.9,"The menu is very small, as is the restaurant itself. I think we counted 32 total seats! I know they didn't used to take reservations, but they have since changed that which is nice - especially now that I've seen how small the space is. We didn't try one thing that I didn't like. Menu standouts were: <p>garlic fries</p>, <p>octopus appetizer</p>, <p>halibut</p>, and <p>veal</p>. They also had an <p>oyster appetizer</p> that was really unique - 3 <p>oysters</p> each prepared a different way. The third was smoked with <p>applewood chips</p> and had a cover on it, so when you opened it up, the <n>smoke</n> billowed out. Delicious! Another plus is that it's a BYOB, with a $5 <n>corkage</n> fee for the whole table. Not bad at all. Finally, the <n>bathroom</n> was so cool! It had a <n>darkroom door</n> leading into it, and the wall was lined with <n>old</n> <n>concert promo posters</n>.,",Ruxbin,Chicago

3.7,"A stop on my food coma trip to Chicago.  Ambiance and decor gets a 7 on the 5 point scale.  Absolutely loved it.. all the different feels to the different spaces yet not disjointed.  Was here on a Tuesday and had the Prix Fixe menu.  For $35 it was a steal of a deal.  Wine was 1/2 off of some bottles.  The food was prepared very well.  I had read some reviews on yelp that made it sound uneven, but mine and my dinner companions meals were spot on.  The only thing I would say is one of my pieces of steak was a tad tough, the others were perfect.  The staff was wonderful as well.  I had the impression that the club might be on the pretentious side with some saying they were declined entry - my friend had been out walking all day and was in running shoes with her slacks, so I was wondering what would happen when we walked in... we were warmly greeted with good-natured bantering (always a plus for me) and directed down the stairs for a lovely evening.  There was a guest that either had some social skill issues or was a tad drunk and a bit too loud - that was the only downside to the night - it was not to the point the staff really should have stepped in, or I am sure they would have, it was just that booth that having your druthers, you would not be next too... had they stepped in it would have been heavy handed, so again props to them in knowing that fine fine line.

4.2,"We stopped in at the Bar on Buena (BOB) this weekend on the 4th of July. It was one of the only restaurants open on the 4th in the Uptown area and came highly recommended from a friend we were with. The 4th was a beautiful day and the BOB had <n>sidewalk</n> <n>seating</n> that has a perfect mix of <n>sun</n> and <n>shade</n>. The BOB was serving a strict brunch-only menu until 3 pm, which was fine because some of us wanted breakfast food, but when a friend asked if they could order their favorite menu item, a simple <p>grilled cheese</p>, the waitress flat out refused. This was the first of the dismal service we experienced while there. Our waitress was outright rude at times (possibly because she was working on a holiday?) and when someone in our party went to the bar to ask for a pen, she was ignored by several staffers who were standing around talking, for several minutes.Luckily, I often find it's the company that makes the experience, so we still had a good time and enjoyed the basic fare. Two of us ordered the Brunch <p>Torta with scrambled egg</p>, <p>guac</p>, and <p>cheese</p> (what could have easily been a grilled cheese if fried, just saying), which was ginormous and filling, if not bland (thank god for <p>siracha</p>).

My mother ordered a <p>chopped salad</p> excluding 3 ingredients but said she wanted everything else in it. My salad arrived looking very strange. The salmon was in these very unappetizing chucks that werent cut but looked like they were ripped apart. When I further looked I realized what the chef and Angelina have given me was the <n>discarded</n> scarps of the fish that were cut off the fillet, it was pure <n>fat</n> and scales that they disguised by the grilling. Absolutely disgusting. I was truly insulted and appalled that any restaurant, chef or wait staff would even serve that to a customer let alone a dog. When I nicely stated the fact to Angelina she offered me another salad that I declined the because of how disgusting the first salad was, and she messed up the order on my mothers, which we declined to tell her about. I then asked her for a <n>plate</n> and <n>cutlery</n> and Angelina took over 10 minutes to bring and when I did see her with just a plate she was attended to another table first while handing my plate and sticking it under her arm and handling god knows what else with the plate she was planning on giving me.

I flew into Chicago from Cambridge to celebrate my best friend’s birthday with his family and partner. We hoped to go out for a nice meal. Having been recently promoted to a one-star Michelin restaurant, we were excited to secure the reservation. In hindsight, we should have gone elsewhere. A truly dismal experience from the reservation process through payment. ServiceAwkward staff with a knack for oversight on details. I spoke with the reservationist and informed her of the birthday celebration. She said she would send out a <n>dessert</n>. This never arrived, nor did any mention of the birthday. We also indicated we were going to be sharing all dishes, and at numerous times throughout the meal, we found ourselves with too few plates. Towards the end of the meal, our server left one plate with no cutlery at the table—our party size was 5.Our server knocked over the sauce for the Mussels and it splashed onto my glass and the table below. No attempt at cleaning up the mess was made, only an unintelligible squawk escaped our server’s mouth. Later in the evening, out server knocked my water glass over causing water to spill onto my lap. At least this time he was apologetic. FoodBy far the worst one-star Michelin experience I have had of the 10 Michelin-star restaurants at which I have dined. The food wasn’t bad, per se, but it was significantly subpar to the Michelin standard.

3.9,"Craft <p>beer</p> <n>excellence</n> paired with <n>delicious food</n>. This place is expanding rapidly with the addition of <n>brewery tanks</n>, coffee bar, and <n>retail</n> store. The atmosphere is reminiscent of a European beer hall. Awesome selection of <n>Two</n> Brothers beers all on tap. I found the dinner menu to be very creative; much better than I expected. I opted for three small plates which was plenty of food: <p>Kebabs</p> (<p>zucchini</p>, <p>mushroom</p>, <p>red onion</p>, <p>bell pepper</p> over <p>basil</p> <p>walnut</p> <p>rice</p>); Grouper (blackened snowy grouper, <p>sweet bacon hash</p>, sage beurre Blane); and Bison (meatballs, north wind cherry <p>BBQ sauce</p>, and zucchini slaw). I would return if my travels bring me back to Aurora.,",Two Brothers Roundhouse,Chicago
4.2,"Gemato's Wood Pit  barbecue is Located in Naperville off Ogden. It came up on my Lunch search and thought to check it out with a friend who was visiting. I thought this will be a sit down restaurant but it is not. Th orders were <p>BBQ Baby Back Ribs</p> <p>Half Slab</p> with <p>Greek style potatoes</p>, <p>baked beans</p> and <p>bread</p>, and <p>Beef Brisket Sandwich</p> with <p>coleslaw</p> on the side. The ribs were <n>tender</n> and melted in my mouth. The beef brisket was very tender as well. The thing I love d,most was the <p>barbecue sauce</p> it was not too sweet like many others . That was perfect for my palate. The baked beans was way too <n>sweet</n> for me , so couldn't finish it.Only crib I had was the food is served in Styrofoam takeaway container. My friend loved it and she said this was one the the best she had ever tasted in her life.Bottom line, the place is worth the hype,",Gemato's Wood Pit BBQ,Chicago
