3.9,"Making reservations for this place would be great. It does get busy during lunch time, when we visited the restaurant. I had the Pacific Halibut, which I haven't had at any restaurant, previously. I thought I'd try something new and it was very good. Not sure it was $35.00 good, but it was a nice change from the fish I usually order which is salmon or tuna. The polenta and spinach bedding the Halibut was served upon was very good as well. The polenta was a tad bit on the firm side, but that may be what they were going for since it had to support the spinach and fish, above it, in its presentation. For desert, I had the chocolate and hazelnut mouse. It was topped with a crisp layer of chocolate that really brought the dish together. Everything was wonderfully presented and the wait staff was attentive and accommodating This place would be great for a business lunch and fancy enough for date night or a celebratory family outing. I'll have to go back to try the many steaks on their menu.,",Kinzie Chophouse,Chicago

Luckily, my carb avoiding ways won out and I was able to enjoy the other fines choices. Portions are generous, feel free to split an entree. The salads, which list as serving two people, actually could serve four. Even the grilled chicken breast, which could be mundane, had nice flavor and moistness. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.The ambiance is noisy, but fun. This is not the place to take someone to break up with them, or work through your personal issues unless you plan on raising your voice. We took my 90 year old grandmother and she thought it was too dark to clearly see the menu. However, once the food was delivered she had fewer complaints.

Enjoy their craft cocktails and some of their American-flared handhelds. The prices are typically Michigan Ave., but the service, portion sizes and food quality are always spot-on. Kick your meal off with their golden, brown and delicious Gourmet Tots appetizer ($11), made with smoked potatoes, prosciutto and served with a truffle crème fraîche. They feature great burgers - all 8ozs, starting at a pricey $15- and one of the best, most flavorful house-cured pastrami sandwiches ($15) in town. The BBQ pork sliders and beef brisket are decent, but I find their sauce to be far too sweet for my North Carolina tastebuds. And most folks swear by their fried chicken sandwich.

I have been here many times over the years and have noticed a dip in the quality overall, but to my standards its still pretty darn good.  Recently I tried their brussel sprout pizza, which was seriously lacking any sprouts, but the deliciousness of the caramelized onions made up for it.  Staff is pretty genuine and really can take care of their customers when it comes to crafting drinks or helping you pick out a wine. This is very family and kid-friendly so it's not your average wine bar in the regular sense.  Would like to see some of the quality come back to some of their food that used to be there and please bring back the prosciuto asparagus appetizer you used to serve!  It was delish!                                                northandred.com,",Frasca Pizzeria and Wine Bar,Chicago

3.4,"Went there for dinner without any reservations and was able to be seated immediately. By the size of the dining room and the number of seats, I could imagine this place getting pretty busy at times. We ordered the pork belly steam bun and chicken steam bun as appetizers. Both were wonderfully tender, tasty, and juicy. The sauces and flavor profiles for each of the buns was great. The pork belly was so tender and the kimchi pickles on the pork bun was not too spicy or kimchi funky. The mixture of mayo and some other hoisen/BBQ sauce on the chicken steam bun made it really original. Onto the main course, veggie ramen and Fatty Ramen"," (the day's special). Both had wonderfully deep, rich broths. My Fatty Ramen dish was a bit tastier since the broth was a little bit thicker and almost creamy. The pork belly was wonderfully tender with crispness on the outside that really added a nice texture when combined with the noodles. I wish they would have separated the bok choi rather than keeping it in tact within the dish. It was a bit awkward trying to separate the leaves so I could have just one leaf with each bite of noodles. The veggie ramen dish was ordered with fried garlic which added a wonderful flavor. The eggplant in the dish, just soaked in all the flavor from the broth making it so delicious. We saved room for desert and opted for the doughnuts with vanilla cream sauce. This is what doughnut holes should be. Each morsel, dunked in the cream sauce was to die for. Even though each bit sized morsel was covered in sugar, adding the cream sauce did not make it too sweet. I do have a sweet tooth though. This is a place we'll have to visit again since there were other items on the menu that sounded divine, but we just didn't have big enough stomachs to try.",Ramen-san

Spreading the butter on the chicken, I felt like I had just discovered a new world.The focus throughout the menu is on locally sourced food where possible.

Located right beside the Morgan el stop in the West Loop, Bar Takito has a large sidewalk patio seating area, and a spacious interior with two bars. The space is bright and colorful and has lots of seating.The menu features Mexican, Central, and South American food with a modern twist. This isn’t the type of place that serves guacamole. Instead they specialize in more unique offerings inspired by seasonal ingredients.We started with the Chorizo & Chicken Arepa. An arepa is a corn pancake, and at Bar Takito it has whole kernels of corn. It was then topped with mushrooms, pickled vegetables, chorizo, chicken, and an aji peanut sauce.The chicken was fried in large pieces, while the chorizo was finely chopped. I really enjoyed the arepa and the sauce, but I think that there was a little too much going on here. Next time I would order the Vegetarian Arepa instead.Next up, two orders of tacos. Takito is known for it’s tacos and they lived up to the hype. The menu includes four different types of tacos, which are served in orders of three. We chose to try the Brunkow Cheese and Coffee Braised Beef tacos.The Brunkow Cheese Tacos came with a large piece of grilled brunkow cheese, pickled jicama, arugula, peanuts, ahi peanut sauce, and a slice of avocado. The cheese was warm and soft and thick, yet not melted.

The ambience by the window was so pretty as we looked outside and got ray of sunshine on us. It was nice. They gave us a dinner menu by mistake and while we were deciding, they switched our menu to a lunch menu. We could still get the dinner stuff if we wanted to. My mom already had her heart set on a dinner pasta. I started to flip and flop. I ended up getting a meatball sandwich from the lunch menu while at first I wanted a chicken dish.We also ordered calamari for appetizer. It was really really good. It looked pale with very thin breading. However, when you ate them... So good! They're super tender, flavorful, humongous! They gave you a lot of gigantic tentacles! Mom and I were kinda fighting for it tho there were plenty. They were so delicious!Her spaghetti came in red sauce with shrimps and scallops and other seafood. The shrimps were huge as well and mom was just enjoying her lunch so much. It was a really big portion and she barely made a dent. She'd be eating that for dinner, lunch, and another dinner.My meatball sandwich was a good size too and they filled the bread with three meatballs. I ate one and half meatballs and was done. The meatballs have great taste but it was too salty for me. The bread also got too soggy to be able to be picked up.Service was great and attentive. A couple of complaints, they kept refilling my ice tea by pitcher, and it was just pure tea and no ice. By the third cup, I had no ice either in my glass. Then, it was just tea, not iced tea. The second one was we had lunch rather early and the whole place was open. They placed a guy to sit by us though there were so many other open spaces. The guy sat so close to us on that tiny nook. It was fun before for me and mom to be able to talk freely and now we had one guy just sitting by us. Lol. No offense, guy. However, a little privacy was preferred. However, overall it was very pleasant and good lunch. Mom enjoyed it and that was all that mattered.",La Sorella di Francesca

3.8,"Based on my personal consumption, I’m  thinking their slogan should be “come for the biscuits, stay for the chicken.”. One of the original highways across America, Route 66 ran from downtown Chicago to the Pacific Ocean at Santa Monica, CA, a total of nearly 2500 miles. It’s also been referred to as “America’s Main Street,” and the “Mother Road.” The highway was instrumental in boosting America’s migration to the west by automobile, and was full of interesting tourist stops, eateries and motels with creative architecture. I’ve written about some of the eateries in the past, including the Maid Rite and Cozy Dog in Springfield, IL, the onion burger establishments in El Reno, OK, Country Cup diner in Countryside, IL, and the Galaxy Diner in Flagstaff, to name a few.                                                ...Read full post on burgersdogspizza.com,",Dell Rhea's Chicken Basket,All Reviews 14

I sat at the bar area and the sitter covering the outside took GREAT care of us when the regular waitress and bartender ignored us.  Food is good and the menu ambitious.  Keep it simple:  pizza, salad and simple pasta.  I had the capellini con pomodoro with a Caesar salad.  The pasta was good; the salad just ok.,",Bella Bacino's,Chicago
3.7,"Beware the valet service at Pegasus!I had the misfortune of dining at Pegasus a few months ago.  The food was unremarkable and we regretted not choosing Greek Islands across the street as we usually do when in town, but the worst part came as we were driving home and discovered several items missing from the car after using their valet!  I called the restaurant but didn't get anywhere.  Eventually I decided to forget about it since the items didn't amount to more than a couple hundred dollars in value - small amount of cash, umbrellas, car charger and cables, sunglasses, etc.I probably wouldn't have written this review, but after a neighbor heard my story, they told something interesting about their experience at Pegasus.  They had used the valet service and when they asked for the car back the attendant walked straight to the car without going to the key box.  Then the attendant opened the unlocked car and pulled the keys from under the mat!  Everything was in full view since the valet parking is just across the street from restaurant entrance.  My neighbor was shocked and fortunately didn't have anything in the car to be stolen, but how easy would it have been for someone to just take the car!I think something fishy is going on here.  If anyone else has had a similar experience please respond.Of course I understand that you have to be careful with any valet service, and I regret being foolish enough to have left some valuables in the car, but leaving cars unlocked with keys in them is just plain inexcusable.  Everyone I have told the story to wonders if the valet didn't have a partner going through the cars.  It's a perfect set up since the restaurant doesn't take responsibility for it.Also, we didn't discover our items missing until we had left Chicago, but if someone else finds items missing at the Pegasus valet, call the police immediately!  They need to know what is going on to make a record and investigate.  You'll probably never get your stuff back, but if enough attention is brought to the problem, maybe it can be prevented for others.,",Pegasus,Chicago

I think one needs to stay away from anything with sauces at Prairie Moon--both my husband and I had entrees with sauce and the sauce overcame both the chicken and the steak.

3.8,"I've always walked by the beautiful outside patio but who knew the interior would prove to be just as wonderful? Wooden communal tables in a line stand atop and glazed brick floor and lead to a back wall full of wines. The menu is very cafe-esque as they have sandwiches and French fare along with a delectable case full of French pastries.-French Onion Soup: it's a bit sweeter than what I like but well made—filled to the brim with onions and delicious soaked bread.-Tuna Melt (fresh beans, olives, tomato, gruyere cheese on sourdough bread): oh my. Delicious! The tuna has such an intense flavor under the salty gruyere. It's like no tuna I've ever tasted—divine. The bread also has a lovely bite to it.  The side salad has is drizzled in a nice balsamic vinaigrette with a hint of added spice.FINAL VERDICT: the food and atmosphere of the place are impeccable.

3.8,"Lack of flexibility is annoying. The food and service here were above average on my visit, but I have to complain about the inflexibility of this restaurant on their fixed-price menu. My husband is allergic to fish and shellfish and they flat-out refuse to make any changes to their set menu for people with food allergies (when we made the reservation we warned them about the issue). They claim that it is because some of the dishes on the menu, even those that aren't fish, are made with stocks and sauces that may contain fish elements. Ok - first of all, why are some of the non-fish dishes on the set menu made with fishy stocks and yet none of the non-fish dishes on the regular menu are made with these same ingredients? These seems a little odd. Second, I don't mean to get uppity here but I have dined in some of the nicest restaurants in the world (Fat Duck, French Laundry and Alinea for example) and never once have we been told that the chef could not change the menu to accommodate allergies. So my question is - why does the chef at North Pond, which by the way is nowhere in the same league as the restaurants mentioned above, refuse to make accommodations for diners who WANT to spend money at his establishment? There are a lot of people with legitimate allergies to food, are they really unwilling to make ANY provision for these people?,",North Pond,Chicago

3.2,"With only three tables, this place offers a simple menu of primarily authentic Mexican cuisine without the fanfare.

3.7,"A smattering pricey for the portion sizes – from the wine pours to entrées - but we would certainly try them again, especially since they’re in our neighborhood (…but only after they fix the air conditioning.) We started off with cocktails, including the Armeni-tini ($11) a light and refreshing pomegranate and vodka martini, and the Chili-Dilly ($10), a tart and mildly spicy chile vodka concoction, served up with a huge sprig of dill. Certainly craft drinks worthy of the price.We started with the Mezza Sampler, which was delivered mere seconds after ordering. The long, three-sectioned plate featured labneh – a “farmer’s cheese dip”- which tasted like plain cream cheese with a fruity olive oil drizzle and a light dusting of paprika. There were two ice-cold, but flavorful, yalanchi sarma - grape leaves stuffed with raisins, almonds and chopped herbs. The trio was rounded out with a decent portion of baba ghannouj, the famously roasted eggplant dip, all served with a basket of rocket-hot pita bread. For $10.95, the offering was a decent way for two people to sample some of their traditional fare.The dining space itself is long and very (very) dark, with several small, semicircular cubby-holes that easily seat two, maybe three, with a third chair. On a recent Saturday night, the back of the room had been set up for a table of 20 when we arrive, but during our 90 minute meal, there were only about a dozen people in the restaurant. There were a few dining tables outside, and the bar can easily seat six to eight people. The bathrooms are down a steep flight of stairs, and were absolutely spotless. One thing we noticed half way through our dining was the temperature in the restaurant was rising rather quickly – despite being directly under an airduct, we could feel no air flowing. Some of the guests around us pointed out the room’s temperature to their waiters, and it sounded like the restaurant was having some problems with their air conditioning.  Feeling the heat, we opted for a glass of the Armenian wine ($9), a fresh and fruity pomegranate-based red, and a glass of one of their summer special white wines, a Pierre et Papa ($9) – sadly, the pours in the small goblets were rather miserly for the money.Much like the appetizers, our entrees arrived very quickly after ordering – the shish kabobs ($20.95) featured perfectly seared cubes of herbaceous lamb, cooked to exactly medium rare and sporting a nice, evenly charred crust. The flavors were spot-on, but the bed of white rice underneath was utterly flavorless. Our second entree, the Armenian Combo –was billed as “a generous serving of sarma, boereg, kufta and eggplant”, but was woefully lacking in generosity at $17.95. The three piece sarma (stuffed grape leaves) were stuffed with minced meat and spices, unfortunately they were covered in a rather tasteless, cheese-like sauce we couldn’t identify. The kufta, a lone, golf ball-sized meatball, was nicely flavored with spices and came swimming in a lemony cream sauce. The boereg was the only real stand out – a perfectly crispy filo-wrapped portion of spinach and cheese. The roasted eggplant was nothing more than a non-pureed version of their baba ghannouj. By now, it was rather stifling inside the restaurant due to the lack of airflow, so instead of ordering desserts and coffee, we opted for our check – just over $104.00, before tip.,",Sayat-Nova,All Reviews 20
4.3,"We ate in the bar which has a bit more atmosphere than the ding room. Good black bean soup; the marinated London broil sandwich sauce had a nice bite.

3.7,"Do not recommend coming here for dinner. It was my significant other and I. We ordered: 1 beer ($11), an order of spring rolls $10 (2 per order), chicken curry($18) and a large", beef pho ($19). The noodles in my curry chicken were over-cooked/swollen/soggy. The , of pho came in a bowl that was the size I normally eat cereal out of. With that aside the flavor was only ok and the service was great. Again I don't recommend coming here for dinner unless you plan on paying $75 for 2 people for average food. If I wasn't so turned off by that experience I might try their lunch since that's what everyone else raves about.
4.0,"Enjoyed the food. Chicken chili was good flavor and nice pieces of chicken. I ordered the boneless short rib, it tasted great but the piece of meat was actually higher up on the chuck and for $27 . ( I know my cuts of meat having helped my father for years in his meat market) it was expensive pot roast. The side of roasted corn was good. My other friends had the trout and salmon which were hit (trout) and miss (overcooked salmon). The concept is great, the execution needs work especially on quality control.,",Seasons 52,Chicago

The place is super clean with no overwhelming smells! We walked in during lunch time on a Sunday and it wasn't too busy. My husband opted for the lunch buffet since it had Lamb curry and that's all he really wanted. I wanted the Chicken Tikka Masala and it wasn't included in the buffet so I ordered it off the menu. The staff was super great and attentive. Our waiter went to the back while I was waiting to give my order and the owner came over and asked if I needed anything. I asked him about the buffet and then asked when the waiter was coming back. He told me to just give him the order and he'll get it in and asked if I wanted a coke or tea. He even brought my plate and drinks! That definitely made an impression on my husband and I. The waiter himself also brought us naan numerous times and refilled our drinks quite often. I loved the service here. The food itself was SO GOOD!!!! My husband had 3 plates and my Chicken tikka masala was super Delicious! They also had some wonderful music playing.

4.0,"The hubs and I were lucky enough to snag a reservation for New Years Eve at Anteprima.  He had never been, and after dining on their beautiful and cozy outdoor patio last summer with some friends, I knew I had to take him.The atmosphere was bustling without being overwhelming.  It was intimate, cozy, and just what we were looking for on our first NYE with just the two of us.They have an extensive wine list, but I stuck to beer (Peroni) as I'm a beer gal.  We started with roasted root vegetables with hazelnuts and rosemary oil which despite being pretty simple was delicious.  We also had the octopus with potatoes, red onion, chilis, parsley, lemon and olive oil - this dish is out of this world - it has a smoky, tangy, bold herbaceous flavor that is perfection.  You must order this dish.For entrees we had the orecchiette with spicy house made lamb sausage, bitter greens, chilis and pecorino as well as the rigatoni with soppressata and ricotta - the pasta was cooked perfectly in both dishes.  The pasta with lamb sausage had delicate flavors that melded together to form an earthy, savory dish that I will order again and again.  The rigatoni had really bright and bold flavors that truly wowed us.  The saltiness of the soppressata against the sweetness of the tomatoes and the creaminess of the ricotta was amazing.  I honestly don't know that I could pick a favorite between these two!Overall, awesome, tasty experience.  I already can't wait to go back.                                givememeatloaf.com,",Anteprima,Chicago

The dip itself was delicious, but the cracker that the serve it with, left a lot to be desired. The cracker would break no matter how you tried to get dip on it. And as soon as it hit your mouth it dissolved. Tasty dip, but needs a vehicle change.My lunch date ordered the Shrimp BLT Sandwich with homemade chips. It was very underwhelming. There were MAYBE 2 shrimp on the sandwich and one slice of bacon. It was very plain and really, not worth it.I ordered the Grilled Beef Tenderloin Sandwich with homemade chips. I must say that this sandwich was wonderful. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium) and the whole sandwich was very flavorful and loaded with meat. Well worth the money they charge for it. The homemade chips, for both sandwiches, were slightly over- AND undercooked. But tasted fine. Will probably head back there, but not in the near future.,",Bijan's Bistro,Chicago

4.0,"The first time we tried to get in here it was late and all of the tables were full. We resolved to come back the next day around what we thought would be an in between lunch/dinner time. Once again all of the tables were full but we were glad to wait about 30 minutes for a table to clear. Once we were seated a whirlwind experience began. We picked the #1 ChaDol-Gui. We noticed the  menu stated it was a portion for 2 so we only ordered it plus a Mul Mandu appetizer. Normally we would order 2 items but I payed attention to the menu and other reviews advising not to order too much. It's a good thing because we had more than enough food for two. Every single thing we ate was good and I do not think we left anything behind. I also paid attention to the negative comments regarding the service and was ready for an abrasive server. Even on the night we were turned away we were politely told that they could not serve us. Even the 2 guys in front of us were told they could not get any take out food. The service was good, fast and efficient. If anyone was going to possibly get bad service, we might have been good candidates because I am Korean and my wife is Caucasian. I don't have a single complaint about our experience and would be ready to go back today.,",Cho Sun Ok,Chicago

The coffee is also well above average.

I couldn't pick a cocktail from the extensive list, so I told my server I liked whiskey, tequila, and mezcal as my drink-bases. They made me a drink that was outstanding. We had the burrata appetizer which was highly recommended from other reviewers, and it did not disappoint. The portions were very generous and we had plenty left over. We split two pastas: hen egg, sage, and brown butter and the crab, sea urchin, and chili taglioni. Both were outstanding. Would order both again in a heartbeat.

4.6,"One of the mythical ice cream shops of Chicago, the original rainbow cone has been a stalwart at Taste of Chicago every year.  But being in Beverly, northsiders like Sam and I have never gotten the chance to try it without making a day out of it.  Luckily we were seeing a comedy show at the Hollywood casino amphitheatre in Tinley park so a quick side trip was in order.  So the deal is that they load up 5 different flavors on one cone for you to give you that patented rainbow look.  I don't know if it's the best ice cream in the world but the flavors went well together.  I never order sherbet so getting some orange was a pleasant surprise.  I'm still not sure what the Palmer house flavor was though.  The coolest part is that they have little cone holders with a little guard to catch any melting ice cream from getting to your hand.  It will happen.  There are a ton of other options like sundaes but we had to get the classic.  Rainbow cone is a must visit for any Chicago ice cream fanatic.  If this was my neighborhood place I'd probably go a few times over the course of a summer.                                  euroatheart.com,",Original Rainbow Cone,Chicago
4.0,"Some of the best ice cream in the city! I've gone a few times, and I always gravitate toward the salted caramel. They don't skimp with the ice cream, packing it high on the cone or cup. The prices are fair for the amount of ice cream you're getting too. The space is a little small and there's usually a line during the summer. But in my opinion, it's worth it!,",Bobtail Ice Cream Company,Chicago

3.5,"This is a great venue for musical acts, and if you’re a huge fan of the artist(s), don’t hesitate to splurge on the front row seats – the setting is as intimate as it gets, mere inches away from the performers on stage. We walked around a little before the show, scoping out the “cheap seats” for our next visit – there really aren’t any “bad” seats in the place, but you wouldn’t want to be too far along the side walls of the venue. The acoustics were great, the view was decent and the restrooms only a few steps away.  We had front row seats for singer/comedian Stephen Lynch and shared the tiniest of tables with an adorable couple from the ‘burbs – to say the tables are “small” is an understatement – think half the size of a folding card table, topped with full place settings for four. Tight. Damn tight. While we introduced ourselves, and laughed off the proximity of our seating, our server extraordinaire recommended an awesome 12-year-old red wine (by the glass, no less!) to my wife and, for me, the first of many (many!) Bulleit Bourbon Old Fashioned cocktails.  We started with some appetizers for the table; the Imported Italian Burrata ($15) featured a massive ball of milky, salty mozzarella cheese and a large portion of olive-oil soaked tommy-toe tomatoes with thickly sliced, perfectly-toasted bread – certainly the highlight of the evening. The Dipping Flight ($13) came with a dollop of flavorless hummus, runny babaganuj and a tiny portion of cold pitas. The Crispy Risotto Balls ($12) were neither crispy or warm, and the goat cheese fondue was set up like a brick of Velveeta. When we handed back our barely touched Dipping Flight and Risotto Balls, our server immediately caught on – and she made up for the faux pas by delivering a round of complimentary drinks.  Sadly, dinner wasn’t much better. The small ramekin of brownish meat for the Braised Duck Tacos ($13) was cold and tasted like sweetly-sauced barbecued chicken. The plate also featured the smallest white corn tortillas we’ve ever seen – barely the size of a beer can coaster. The side dish of Fingerling Potatoes ($9) were certainly reheated in the microwave and had a funky lemony back taste. The wife’s Kale Salad ($12) was nicely portioned and had a large serving of quinoa, croutons and was perfectly dressed with a flavorful anchovy dressing.  During the entire evening, our server was remarkably attentive and, as promised, kept the bourbon coming for the duration of the performance. She was so spot-on, the neighboring table twice leaned in to ask if they could “borrow” our waitress – apparently their server went AWOL between courses. We will certainly return to catch some more shows, but we might opt for dinner elsewhere.,",City Winery Chicago,All Reviews 9

3.9,"FOOD: If you know enough math to calculate the permutations, you'll find that B&TB offers you many thousands of possible build-your-own combinations of burgers, spices, buns, and toppings. I narrowed them down by making conservative, classic, heroic choices that reflect the traditional values of middle America. Here's what I wound up with: Natural & Local House Blend Beef with Chicago Steakhouse spice blend on a Split Top Butter Egg bun with American Cheese, Lettuce, Bread & Butter Pickles, Yellow Mustard, Mayo, and Ketchup – $9.35. Medium-rare. I paid almost $10 for a single burger. Question is, was it $10 good? It was a lot of burger, made with exceptional ingredients. Ten dollars will by you a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese Meal, plus a McFlurry. Or it will buy you the burger of kick-ass perfection and you get to bring your own beer (because it's BYOB). You do the math. I also had some Homemade Potato Chips – $1.50. I found them to be too greasy. That may reflect my tastes more than the quality of the chips. In any case, I tossed'm. SERVICE: You order and pay up front, then find your own seat and they find you when your burger's ready. Usually that means you'll never see a server again once you get your food.

4.2,"Great service and great food. Our server, Jeanette, was wonderful. We had seven people in our group and we wanted to try several dishes but couldn't narrow down our choices. She was attentive to what we wanted and suggested family style among other things. She checked in to make sure we were all doing fine. She put our order in two sets so we weren't overwhelmed with the salads, appetizers, pastas, and entrees we ordered. And at the end when we left we forgot our leftovers she ran outside to give it to us. The food was delicious - our favorite dishes were the mushroom ravioli and mushroom risotto. The ravioli was a well-balanced flavorful dish. The risotto was smoky and creamy but not mushy. The braised lamb shank was very tender and matched well with the saffron orzo. I was looking forward to the butternut squash ravioli but it was just a little too sweet for my palate. Overall though it was great and I'd go back any day.,",Zia's Trattoria,Chicago
4.4,"I feel so lucky (and maybe unlucky?) that Buona Terra is right around the corner from me on California. This family-owned restaurant is intimate, yet lively. I first went with my roommate's family, then with my own... and saw another friend there with her parents. So yeah, it's definitely a crowd-pleaser.First, you get free bread with this delicious garlic spread...already worth the price of admission, I know. Then, you should either order the Carpaccio de Barbabietola (beet salad with fried goat cheese) or the Panzanella Toscana, which is a super light and fresh tomato/cucumber/olive salad.For your main, you can't go wrong with anything, really, but I'd stay away from the daily specials and go straight for the Rigatoni Buona Terra (especially if you're a big goat cheese fan - see a theme, here?). My other favorites are the Ravioli con Vitello and the Gnocchi Verde al Quattro Formaggi. The staff is super friendly and attentive, and I love their wine list.My only suggestion would be unlimited pasta for neighbors. ;) If Zomato had emojis, I would give two thumbs up!,",Buona Terra,Chicago

They were not terribly busy. Two waitresses appeared to be finished with a large group who seemed to be dining on a buffet set up just for their group. When the waitress (short blond hair) finally arrived to take our order, she said it was after three and we couldn't order brunch. Why were we given brunch menus, I wondered. I told her if they were more prompt in taking our order we would have gotten in under the time limit. Then she argued with me about when she arrived!  I couldn't believe it. Where in the customer service training manual does it say argue with your customers","? WTF!!! I told the bartender why we were leaving.

They back this up by offering jazz in the bar on a nightly basis for free. Their happy hour specials are one of the best in all of Chicago on Thursday nights. They offer $7.00 drinks from a select menu of top shelf beverages and the same $7.00 food items that are very filling and quite delicious. They extend this happy hour special to service industry folks all day on Sundays. The nightly happy hour menu is slightly more, but relatively speaking, still a good deal.

It seemed like the menu was pretty standard. You'll find burgers and fried apps like mozzarella sticks, with some steaks and seafood things as well.  This is the kind of place where you pretty much know what's on the menu before you walk in the door.  Not that it's necessarily a bad thing. If that's what you want, you know you won't be disappointed. There wasn't anything that I was too impressed with but everyone I was with seemed to enjoy.  I will say this though, the inferno burger was Damn spicy.  And I can take the heat.  For being in Schaumburg this place is just fine hence the 3 stars. The service and quality of the food was good. There was just nothing that stood out to me.  I'd say its a good spot for a family gathering as they are very accommodating for large groups.                                                euroatheart.com,",Stonewood Ale House,Chicago

3.8,"This place does not have the typical sushi menu, so it took a bit of time to find some food items that spoke to me.  I tried the chicken lettuce wraps, soft shell crab roll, unagi trio roll, and spicy tuna roll.  The lettuce wraps were spicy and very messy, just a warning to prepare yourself.  The soft shell crab roll was good, actually lighter than the usual soft shell crab roll so it didn't taste as greasy.  The unagi roll was yummy, but I am a huge fan of eel and the sweet eel sauce.  The spicy tuna roll was a familiar roll, similar to every other sushi place.  But there is nothing wrong with that.  Our service was great, the waiters brought the food out as it was ready very promptly.  So far it was a wonderful experience, the only bad part was the owner/manager(not sure who she was, she alluded to owning the place in her conversation) spent half our meal with her butt in our face.  She apparently knew the couple at the next table well and got into a deep conversation with them about their daughter and her shared love of jumping horses with the couple. Yes she was close enough that I could have been included in the conversation as well.  I either could stare at my dinner partner or the kitchen, looking outside wasn't an option because she was standing right next to me, facing the couple, and have her conversation. It was only as we were getting our check that she decided to just sit down next to the couple, instead of standing next to me with her butt in my face.,",Mirai,Chicago

It seems a little suspect; they have an array of burgers, all with a ton of craaaaazy, wild shit on them, but the standout one, The Lockdown Warden, is all leeks and cheese. I’m on board with that. I like leeks. Not to mention the cheese. Although the restaurant’s website is full of a bunch of metal images and it’s emblazoned with the Iron Maiden logo, I feel like if a restaurant is brave enough to do something with leeks on a burger, I should go.A cascade of Freddie Mercuries greet me on three televisions as I walk in. That’s cool. Queen is something we can all agree on, correct? I like to think if I had started up a conversation about “A Day at the Races” with those hard rock kids back in high school, our shoulders might have straightened a little and we might have had a decent conversation.And It’s a beautiful burger. Lovely to gaze upon. Green, yellow fireworks topped with a pretzel bun. I’m excited. I am the champion, my readers.But no. It’s terrible. The meat is doughy. Meat’s not a carbohydrate. Burger meat should not be doughy. I know, I know it’s grass-fed beef. Yes, farm to table. But it doesn’t taste right. And the Merkts cheddar, which has been stuffed inside the patty, squirts out the other end, onto the plate. Not in my mouth. I’m left with a lot of leeks about as frazzled as I am, and a doughy burger. I scoop up the cheese sauce with my finger in an effort to save myself, but apparently it’s children and men first because I’ve not been saved with this action and I’m drowning in regret.I want to like this burger. No one makes a burger with leeks. If there was a food draft, I’d like to think that my tribe picked leeks, like, third. The flavor can evolve so deliciously drastically: coyly sweet but crisp one way, warm, mild and tender another. But bite after bite, the leeks seem to further dull the flavor in the rest of the dish. Maybe they were overfried. I had such high hopes once.I assume it’s me. The burger was too hard rockin’ for little “The Shins made me cry once” me. Honestly, though, it felt as though the Warden burger was a Loggins and Messina production. Burgers or sandwiches piled high with a pound of crap, even if it’s one ingredient of crap, was never my scene. I want to taste complexity in the meat. I want to taste the balance of cheese against that burger.                                thesandwichdamsel.com,",Lockdown Bar & Grill,Chicago

My husband got the Blueberry Vandermill Cider and got a free State/Lake coosie with each can.For food we tried the Poutine, Pimento Cheese Dip with Chips, and Soft Pretzel with Red Pepper and Goat Cheese Dip. The Poutine came with bacon and peas and was super cheesy and delicious, not weighed down in gravy like Poutine can be. The Pimento Dip was good, but far and away, the real winner was the pretzel with goat cheese and red pepper dip. It tasted like a jalapeño popper without being fried, and the pretzel was crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside. I don't usually like goat cheese, but I loved this. And the presentation of all the dishes was creative. The only downside was the service. Apparently we got caught in a shift change and had quite the time trying to track someone down to pay our bill (like 20+ minutes of waiting for someone give our money to).

So they give you a bowl with stick on which you are supposed to write your name. I think they have different bowls for lunch and dinner, the lunch one being smaller. You get variety of buffet options, mostly Asian to choose from. The only catch is they let you select only one protein, which you need to write in a piece of sheet stuck to the stick with your name.

3.6,"I've been to many ramen places in Chicago. Wasabi was my top one in my mind! Been there three times and each time I was happy with the food and service they provided.The menu has quite different ranges of food starting from appetizers to grilled skewers, from fresh sashimi to all sorts of maki/nigiri rolls, from ramen to rice dish. You can always find something you like.The oyster shot had no alcohol in it. It was more like a ceviche with raw oyster, fish roe and quail egg. Tasted really fresh and smooth.The chicken skin skewers was my favorite since I did enjoy the burnt chicken fat smell as well as the chewy but delicious skin. The other skewers were not bad either, recommended to order few and share.The all sorts of different flavors of sushi roll were really nice too! Fresh ingredients with a little bit traditional/creative ideas. Perfect for sharing as well.As I said, you have to try the ramen! The soup was not salty at all(not like other places) and tasted so good, it was seasoned perfectly! The poached egg was in perfect condition with runny but custard like centre. The pork belly was so tender and full of flavor...I just love everything about this ramen! Wasabi could be pretty busy during dinner time and weekends, recommend make advanced reservation if you can. Hope you will like the ramen and other food there like I do :),",Wasabi,Chicago

4.0,"I think I need to give this place a second chance and try the sushi this time. The service is prompt and courteous, the ambiance is great, the outdoor seating is great but that's where all the positive stops for me. My friend received a dirty spoon for your miso soup. And it didn't get any better after that. We had noodle dishes which I think might be our error. The food was lacking. Over cooked seafood, bland flavorless dishes  and nothing to rave about. I have heard the sushi is great but unfortunately I didn't have sushi and therefore was disappointed. With so many options I don't know if I want to give this place a second shot.,",Kansaku,Chicago

They only filled half the compartment of the take out tray. The burrito was bland. It had no seasoning, no flavor, very little taste. There was no lettuce and very little tomatoes. I cannot recommend this dinner and will not go there again. Bottomline - overpriced and blah food.The restaurant would be a wonderful place for a date. It's very dark and cozy.

I'm not sure how you could make a pie better than that and I'll probably be back for any of my pie related needs. The only thing is that this location is pretty much a take out only store.

3.8,"It was a bright Saturday hot afternoon, so I decided to have some beer over here.And here was an unexpected great experience waiting for me in Emmett.As I went in,it was almost empty with few people in dining and bar area.I was received nicely at reception and seated comfortably.Patrick was my server on that day and he suggested to try German Kolsch as a cooler and refreshing beer for the hot afternoon.As this was my first experience in a brewery so I ordered a beer paddler which is a combination of 5 beers (Munich Light German Lager, 1 AM English Ale, Emmett's Pale Ale, Emmett's Red Ale, Porters and Stouts). I personally loved German Lager which was crisp and refreshing.For food I ordered Three Wings Sampler(one of each buffalo, Jamaican Jerk and red ale BBQ) and Emmett's Nachos with Emmett's Club Sandwich.Food was really good, but the service made it better.I have read many average as well as bad reviews of this place, but as far as my experience it was excellent and I would soon be there again to try out more items on menu.                                instagram.com,",Emmett's Brewing Company,Chicago
3.7,"Sheffield's is a north side classic. The beer garden is phenomenal and and inside is bigger than it looks. The food is better than average bar food (especially the nachos and grilled cheese) which makes it a great weeknight destination. The beer selection is large and always diverse with good monthly selections. The service can skew a little on the slow side, but as long as you know that going in, it isn't usually an issue (for me at least).,",Sheffield's,Chicago
3.7,"Came here for dinner and had an amazing time. We were a pretty big party and they seated us even though half our party wasn't there yet. Love the modern take on an Italian restaurant which creates a modern feel but still has touched that obviously show this is an Italian restaurant. Very fun upbeat atmosphere and not at all pretentious. The various options of unique bruschettas was amazing! Had the spicy salami and ricotta bruschetta and I was very impressed! Light and delicious. The pasta were delicious without being heavy. The carbonara did not have mushroom and peas unlike all other carbonaras I've had, however, it was definitely delicious, not extremely creamy or salty, light and fresh. Everything we had was light, fresh, and over all delicious. It is the type of place where you can overeat without falling into a food coma. Service was attentive without bring over bearing.

3.8,"In my wife's quest to eat the best ice cream in the city Black Dog was the next on the list.  Last night was our third attempt to visit this place as they were closed for the season a while ago and a storm had affected their gelato making abilities last week.  Well worth the wait though.I believe Black Dog is cash only so plan accordingly.  Once you're inside you'll see they have about a dozen or so flavors but each one is really unique.  Ginger, goat cheese, sweet corn, peach tea, cinnamon, fig blossom and chocolate chip, just to name a few off the top of my head.  I went with the unexpectedly satisfying sweet corn mixed with a classic cookies n creme.  Probably a weird flavor mix but who cares it was great gelato.  You could taste the corn really clearly and if you've ever had a corn cookie from Momofuku Milk Bar in New York you'll know what I'm talking ant and how it makes a really perfect addition to a dessert. That's not it though.  They had a cooler with pre packed pints of day old ice cream. There was a deal 3 for $10!!

3.6,"WORST RESTAURANT IN PALOS. This is the worst restaurant I have ever been too, for food and service. I would not recommend this to my enemies. The only one good thing was sitting on the roof. When we first got there one of the members of our group ordered a glass of White Zin, it was the color of apple cider vinegar and so was the taste, it was sent back. My husband and I ordered a bottle of wine and each of us requested a glass of ice to go with it. My husband got a glass of ice, I did not. We then ordered calamari as an appetizer. It was brought to our table, but none of us had utensils or napkins, so it sat for five minutes until someone could get us utensils. I asked for a glass of ice again. Still don't have it after ten minutes. We then place our food order. Two diners ordered salad and four of us ordered soup. Two diners received their salad and one diner received their soup. The other three of us assumed our soup we be brought out immediately after theirs. Finally our dinners come, we tell them three of us are still waiting for our soup. We told the we would take it to go. I then asked for my glass of ice. Two diners had the salmon, which they said was okay and another diner had the steak which he said was good. One of the other diners had Eggplant Parmesan which she said was extremely soggy. Another diner had the Rigatoni Caprese, which had not taste and the pasta was overcooked. I had the Lemon Chicken, which needed seasoning, I normally do not use salt and this really needed it. The plate was very white, the angel hair pasta was overcooked. We finally got our check and I received my glass of ice. We never did receive our soups to take home. DO NOT GO HERE TO EAT!! The view was nice but that is the only thing that is worth it. If you want really GREAT Italian food, go one block south to Capri, it is the BEST!!! I wouldn't waste my time or money to go here again even if they have a nice view.,","Sam Buca's Restaurant, Bar and Rooftop",Chicago

3.6,"On Sunday, they offer brunch menu. I guess less items but keep the popular ones. This is our first time, so we decided to try the famous fat rice"," and along with two small entrees-beef croquettes and house-made dumplings. The croquettes was made of mashed potatoes and had a little bit curried beef mince in it, deep frying made it crunchy outside but still soft inside. As soon as I tasted the dumplings, I knew it was handmade. The skin was thicker and more chewy, we loved it with little bit chili sauce. Ok, the ",! It was very overwhelming in a good way! It is a mix of everything-BBQ pork sausage curry chickenprawn clam olives etc.The rice was hidden underneath cooked with shredded duck and Chinese sausage plus sweet&sour grapes. The every component was very delicious especially the rice a combination of full flavors! You have to try it!!!!! The size is perfect for 3-4 ppl. The dessert part we especially enjoyed the portuguese egg tart flaky shell+creamy custard filling nothing is better than that. This place is definitely worth trying. Love to go back and try more different dishes!

The overall ambience of the place is welcoming and comfortable with soft music in the background. The staff is patient and the service is good.Talking about the menu, dal makhni is a must try. We also ordered a non veg platter in which the fish and lamb pieces were surprisingly good. For breads, we ordered bitter and garlic naan along with curries including mutton roghan josh and chicken makhni, which were all equally tastyThe dessert menu was short, with limited options. We ordered kheer and pista kulfi. The kheer was great, not too sweet, just the perfect amoumt. The kulfi was just okay.The bar didn't have much options to choose from.

I had a chance to sample a lot of options on their menu at their soft opening and can tell you I'll be going back.

3.6,"I like Kitsch'n on Roscoe. Well, I have two hours to kill as I wait to meet my son, so I had brunch at Kitsch’n on Roscoe in Chicago, and now you get the benefit of an incredibly detailed review of the one item that I ate!!I ordered the “Candied Bacon Brunch BLT”.Wow, it was delicious, and I recommend that you try it if you eat here.Here is the menu description: Scrambled egg, candied apple-wood smoked bacon, tomato and romaine on butter-griddled Brioche with honey-mayo, accompanied by Danish hashbrowns.Although the bread looks like ordinary white bread, it’s actually brioche baked into a sandwich loaf shape. “Butter-grilled” makes it soft, not crispy. Soft might also be a general feature of brioche, I’m not sure. I was satisfied with the soft texture, but normally I prefer crispy toast for a BLT. Keep that in mind if you, too, have a crispy/soft preference for BLT toast.The scrambled egg was delicious. Technically a “folded egg”, meaning I could see that it was cooked thinly and then folded over twice to give it a nice height and volume. I think that also makes a tidy sandwich, as chunks of scrambled egg don’t fall off the sandwich when you pick it up.There was a generous amount of bacon, delicious, and the sweetness was subtle, probably appropriate for a sweet/savory sandwich like this. It seemed like maybe it was brushed with brown sugar while frying, it was not thickly coated with a candied crust or anything.The tomato and romaine were generous, fresh and crisp.The honey-mayo was thin and subtly sweet, not heavy handed.Danish hashbrowns are awesome and delicious, I loved them. They are thick cubes of skin-on potatoes, prepared with purple onions, red peppers and lots of fresh rosemary. These are very strong flavored and well-seasoned, so again keep that in mind if you prefer traditional shredded hashbrowns, or breakfast potatoes that are milder.I’m here at 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon on a Wednesday, so the place is empty. But they can be quite busy during normal meal times.Kitsch’n on Roscoe is a “famous” restaurant that’s quite popular, it’s been featured on at least one television show, and has a great local reputation. The retro environment is wonderful. I suppose it’s an “intentionally kitschy” planned décor rather than “these genuine articles have been here for 50 years”, but it’s definitely comfy and charming.I had an awesomely friendly and competent server. I saw other reviews indicating that some servers here are not always so.When it comes to the price of restaurant food, I’ve totally lost perspective regarding what is “bargain”, “appropriate” or “overpriced”. Lately, to me, everything seems expensive!! The entrée I described was $9.50. That’s probably normal for this type of restaurant in Chicago’s Roscoe Village, Lakeview and Lincoln Park neighborhoods.,",Kitsch'n on Roscoe,Chicago
3.9,"The menu is very small, as is the restaurant itself. I think we counted 32 total seats! I know they didn't used to take reservations, but they have since changed that which is nice - especially now that I've seen how small the space is. We didn't try one thing that I didn't like. Menu standouts were: garlic fries, octopus appetizer, halibut, and veal. They also had an oyster appetizer that was really unique - 3 oysters each prepared a different way. The third was smoked with applewood chips and had a cover on it, so when you opened it up, the smoke billowed out. Delicious! Another plus is that it's a BYOB, with a $5 corkage fee for the whole table. Not bad at all. Finally, the bathroom was so cool! It had a darkroom door leading into it, and the wall was lined with old concert promo posters.,",Ruxbin,Chicago

I'll reveal why as you read on...or IF you read on.I ordered the black bean burger with a side salad & it was surprisingly good. If you're a normal veggie burger eater than you know its hard to find one that doesn't completely fall into a million pieces after the first bite...that did not happen & was lovely. It's strange but the amount of avocado I was given was way too much. My boyfriend ordered the southwest omelet & enjoyed it aside from the chorizo tasting more like hamburger meat than chorizo.My first complaint came from the rather rushed service that still left my coffee empty for quite some time. And while we're talking about coffee...my biggest complaint is that once I drank my mug to the bottom I noticed an old coffee ring that had been left inside from prior use. It easily rubbed off with my finger which tells me the glass was not washed. It left me feeling quite ill.Also, it's cash only. But they do offer an ATM inside.,",Jam 'n Honey,Chicago

I don’t crave sweets, don’t mind life without chocolate and will take my caramel salted, thank you. In my food adventures, I have eaten fancy desserts, pastries and candies galore. I usually take a couple bites and then I am done. I opt for desserts that are fruit based and not very sweet.But there is one dessert that tempts me every time. It is like a siren call, almost completely irresistible. It is frozen custard and my favorite comes from Scooter’s in Chicago. Rich and creamy, this custard is what ice cream WANTS to be when it grows up. At Scooter’s, custard is an art form. Vanilla and chocolate are always present. They have seasonal flavors (pumpkin in the fall is lovely!) and a ton of mix-ins available. Would you like a slice of apple pie mixed into your custard? Chocolate chip cookie dough? Heath Bar? Bananas? There are as many favorite combos as there are people.True to form my favorite thing on the menu here is a strawberry concrete: velvety vanilla custard with fresh strawberries mixed in. It is simple and simply brilliant. I think I am in love. I would eat one of those anytime.

I had eaten here twice, the first experience was so bad I didn't want to go back because Candance W. was my server and she was bad the first time.

We ended up with the same bad server and we sat there for 1 hour and 45 minutes waiting on 3 small pizza's that, after we asked, only take 15 min to make.... My daughters cheese pizza was burnt and I requested another one, the Manager Dave, came to our table to confront me in an argumentative manor telling me the pizza was not burnt, that is the way they serve their pizzas. My pizza was not burnt and when I pointed that out to him he became angry and said, he could not explain that one, but the cheese pizza was not burnt. It was burnt all around. I told Dave, fine we will just take it I didn't want to argue, Dave then said, No the pizza is mine now.... and jerked the pizza out of my hands and borderline assaulted me. What a professional Manager...(not) Dave must have told the kitchen not to make the rest of our order because we sat there waiting for it.

3.8,"Hands down the BEST Italian Beef sandwich I’ve had since arriving in Chicago two years ago. The amazingly tender meat arrives lovingly cradled in a super-soft, foot-long roll that holds the entire package snugly together.  Ask for yours “wet”, and they’ll dunk the entire sandwich in the au jus before wrapping it up in classic wax paper. If you’re feeling adventurous, order the “Combo” and they’ll lay a perfectly–charred, spicy(!) sausage across the length of your sandwich – but plan on a nap afterwards!Other offerings include a meatball sandwich, a “cuppa tree” different cold subs, a wide selection of Italian-style pizzas (pan and thin, whole and by-the-slice) and made-to-order calzones. Also available are classic Chicago-style Vienna hotdogs, cheeseburgers and fried sides ranging from fries to cheese.Arrive early – things get busy starting at 11:30am on the weekdays. And the place suffers from a bit of dis’feng shui, with two and three lines of folks snaking up to the stage-like platform where you place your order.

The staff are all friendly and fun to talk to, and they'll definitely tell you some of the more ridiculous stories. The problem is the patrons. It's generally a bro-fest, and the night we went we saw our share of ridiculousness. A girl that took her shoes off and was standing barefoot on the sticky floor. Another girl that was basically riding her boyfriend in the middle of everyone.

We don't need to go to a stinkin' chain!Well...Let me get this out of the way: the food was all fabulous! NO complaints whatsoever.But since food is only 50% of the experience for me, the environment and ambience matter a lot.From the second we walked in the front door, the ambience and the service and the staff were the equivalent of that found in the finest NY restaurants.I was floored. After all, this was a ",!Three hostesses were so classy and so trained and so wonderful---handled our arrival and direction to table (we had a big party) seamlessly. We all felt so comfortable.The 2nd tier wait staff were invisible and unintrusive---yet everything was handled.Then came the rise of the curtain. Career server Seth Kayton appeared and it was a one-man theatre production the rest of the way. Classy. Skilled. Knowledgeable. He was a joy.And he comped us dessert as we had a couple of big events we were celebrating AND took our picture and presented it to us. Mama mia.And one thing I remember is that he took care of EACH of us individually and personally as he took care of the entire party. It was something to behold.What a fabulous time we had. NO regrets. Cannot wait to return to Chicago.

I ordered the brocolli and cheese omelette and added grilled chicken.  It came with potatoes and a small stack of pancakes.  The omelette was a bit dry as it was slightly overdone.  The taste however was very good.  I thought they could have used more cheddar cheese.  It appeared they only put a slice on top which I was inadequate.  The pancakes were just ok.

4.2,"We stopped in at the Bar on Buena (BOB) this weekend on the 4th of July. It was one of the only restaurants open on the 4th in the Uptown area and came highly recommended from a friend we were with. The 4th was a beautiful day and the BOB had sidewalk seating that has a perfect mix of sun and shade. The BOB was serving a strict brunch-only menu until 3 pm, which was fine because some of us wanted breakfast food, but when a friend asked if they could order their favorite menu item, a simple grilled cheese, the waitress flat out refused. This was the first of the dismal service we experienced while there. Our waitress was outright rude at times (possibly because she was working on a holiday?) and when someone in our party went to the bar to ask for a pen, she was ignored by several staffers who were standing around talking, for several minutes.Luckily, I often find it's the company that makes the experience, so we still had a good time and enjoyed the basic fare. Two of us ordered the Brunch Torta with scrambled egg, guac, and cheese (what could have easily been a grilled cheese if fried, just saying), which was ginormous and filling, if not bland (thank god for siracha). The best thing about this meal was honestly the flavorful jalapeno rice and beans. My husband ordered the Tres Leches French Toast, which sounded fancier than they actually were. We also had several brunch beers and mimosas while there and the BOB seemed to be well-stocked.Overall, I'd give the BOB another chance to try out their dinner menu if in the neighborhood again, but would have little expectations for the service.                                windycity-wanderlust.blogspot.com,",The Bar on Buena,Chicago

We were seated at table 4/1 and served by Angelina.I ordered the salmon crusted salad and asked our waitress Angelina if I can please have the salmon grilled she said it was no problem. My mother ordered a chopped salad excluding 3 ingredients but said she wanted everything else in it. My salad arrived looking very strange. The salmon was in these very unappetizing chucks that werent cut but looked like they were ripped apart. When I further looked I realized what the chef and Angelina have given me was the discarded scarps of the fish that were cut off the fillet, it was pure fat and scales that they disguised by the grilling. Absolutely disgusting. I was truly insulted and appalled that any restaurant, chef or wait staff would even serve that to a customer let alone a dog. When I nicely stated the fact to Angelina she offered me another salad that I declined the because of how disgusting the first salad was, and she messed up the order on my mothers, which we declined to tell her about. I then asked her for a plate and cutlery and Angelina took over 10 minutes to bring and when I did see her with just a plate she was attended to another table first while handing my plate and sticking it under her arm and handling god knows what else with the plate she was planning on giving me. I obviously told her I did not want that plate. A) On how long it took for her to give to me and B) how gross is it to hold and handle a customer’s plate in that way.My family and friends will never return to Clubhouse again your staff is extremely unwelcoming at the hostess post and all of your staff including cooks is unprofessional and insulting.

3.7,"My friends and I were thoroughly unimpressed with our dining experience at Dusek’s Board and Beer on the 17th of May, 2016. I flew into Chicago from Cambridge to celebrate my best friend’s birthday with his family and partner. We hoped to go out for a nice meal. Having been recently promoted to a one-star Michelin restaurant, we were excited to secure the reservation. In hindsight, we should have gone elsewhere. A truly dismal experience from the reservation process through payment. ServiceAwkward staff with a knack for oversight on details. I spoke with the reservationist and informed her of the birthday celebration. She said she would send out a dessert. This never arrived, nor did any mention of the birthday. We also indicated we were going to be sharing all dishes, and at numerous times throughout the meal, we found ourselves with too few plates. Towards the end of the meal, our server left one plate with no cutlery at the table—our party size was 5.Our server knocked over the sauce for the Mussels and it splashed onto my glass and the table below. No attempt at cleaning up the mess was made, only an unintelligible squawk escaped our server’s mouth. Later in the evening, out server knocked my water glass over causing water to spill onto my lap. At least this time he was apologetic. FoodBy far the worst one-star Michelin experience I have had of the 10 Michelin-star restaurants at which I have dined. The food wasn’t bad, per se, but it was significantly subpar to the Michelin standard. Gilt Bar and Girl and the Goat which only have Bib Gourmand status blow Dusek’s food quality out of the water.,",Dusek's,Chicago
3.9,"Craft beer excellence paired with delicious food. This place is expanding rapidly with the addition of brewery tanks, coffee bar, and retail store. The atmosphere is reminiscent of a European beer hall. Awesome selection of Two Brothers beers all on tap. I found the dinner menu to be very creative; much better than I expected. I opted for three small plates which was plenty of food: Kebabs (zucchini, mushroom, red onion, bell pepper over basil walnut rice); Grouper (blackened snowy grouper, sweet bacon hash, sage beurre Blane); and Bison (meatballs, north wind cherry BBQ sauce, and zucchini slaw). I would return if my travels bring me back to Aurora.,",Two Brothers Roundhouse,Chicago
4.2,"Gemato's Wood Pit  barbecue is Located in Naperville off Ogden. It came up on my Lunch search and thought to check it out with a friend who was visiting. I thought this will be a sit down restaurant but it is not. Th orders were BBQ Baby Back Ribs Half Slab with Greek style potatoes, baked beans and bread, and Beef Brisket Sandwich with coleslaw on the side. The ribs were tender and melted in my mouth. The beef brisket was very tender as well. The thing I love d,most was the barbecue sauce it was not too sweet like many others . That was perfect for my palate. The baked beans was way too sweet for me , so couldn't finish it.Only crib I had was the food is served in Styrofoam takeaway container.

4.1,"Review for Ruth's Chris Steak House. The food was superb. Felt a little rushed at times to order, but that was probably just good service in that they checked in with us so often.

Overall, a great evening with great food and great service.,",Ruth's Chris Steak House,Chicago
3.7,"Yummy pre-movie dinner. We decided to try The Peasantry before going to see a movie at the Landmark Century. We had an early family dinner and arrived when there was only one other table seated. The service was great and the staff very knowledgeable about the menu. We tried mussels, a salad, some entrees and sandwiches. All was very good with interesting flavors. I liked that portions were plenty but not enormous. Specials that stood out included an arugula salad with a blood orange dressing, a rabbit sandwich and a duck BLT with fried green tomatoes. The vegetarian plate was a good option for a lighter entree. Prices are reasonable for the quality. We'll definitely return!,",The Peasantry,Chicago

In all seriousness though, I have only come here for brunch and have never been disappointed. The specials tend to be where it's at, with the chorizo chilaquiles being an ok general menu option. I ordered the chicken fried steak with sawmill gravy, potatoes, eggs, and toast. It was quite good, even though I don't tend to be a fan of any gravy. My girlfriend's breakfast chimichangas were huge and delicious when I ate the large amount leftover later that night. Eventually I plan on getting around to the chicken that I suppose they're predominantly known for.,",Feed,Chicago
3.7,"Excellent food. Went here with my family on a recent Chicago trip as it was just around the corner from our hotel. The chicken kids meal was HUGE and all of us loved it. My wife had the wings and I had the Corn Beef Hash Reuben, which was excellent as well. It is not a sandwich, but a mixture of hash browns, corn beef, sauerkraut and I topped them off with scrambled eggs. Server was super friendly and made the experience even better. You should go!,",Kerryman,Chicago

We walked in and it was seat yourself so we chose a table outside, though I wouldn't have minded inside either as it had a nice ambiance. My boyfriend and I decided to do a shared plates"," kind of meal even though that's not really the style of the restaurant. We started with the soft pretzel which was warm & fluffy (just the way it should be!). It was served with a chocolate stout mustard which complimented it really well. From there, we had the House Sausage Sampler. I'm not usually one to incorporate sausage into my meals, but these were so tasty I was completely satisfied. The sampler came with three types of sausage: Cuban with pickles and two types of mustard (my favorite of the sampler), Italian with marinara and giardiniera, and a duck/bacon sausage served over lettuce with aioli. All three were really good. For dessert we ordered ", which was basically s'mores with bourbon vanilla marshmallows enough for the two of us to split at the end of the meal. The overall experience was positive the wait staff attentive and a place I'd go back to!Also shout out to the group who came in as we were leaving and apologized for being rowdy  - you weren't! You definitely made our great experience even greater by picking up our bill (I hope you see this!). Thank you!
4.0,"What a find!. In town visiting my daughter. Stopped a random local couple walking by and they sent us there. Urban contemporary interior. Very welcoming. Great service.

It's topped with onions, jalapeños and cheese and the crock is put direct on the grill to melt it. Eat at the bar for the cooking show and the fast hot service.

3.6,"Full disclosure, my wife and I came in using the $120 Groupon for the tasting menu on 8/9.  When I saw that I had to snap it up.  We don't usually splurge on high end fine dining but thought this would be a great opportunity to test the waters.  Upon stepping in the door the service is phenomenal.  You're led to your table and you can see there's a brigade of servers floating around making sure your water is never less than half full and meticulously placing new silverware with each course.  Once you're settled the service starts and it is definitely an experience. The tasting menu had about 10 courses overall.  Each one was presented in a unique way.  If you're looking for big portions you may be disappointed but to be honest I was satisfied by the end.  I could describe everything but I'm sure the menu changes fairly often so here were the highlights. - Fried oyster coated in granola was something I didn't even know was a thing.  Plus they served it in the shells but those shells were placed in this planter filled with sticks and pebbles.  -The salmon was the most delicate piece of fish I've ever had. I don't even enjoy fish and it was cooked just rare so that it was flaky and amazing.  - Clam chowder that was prepared at the table. The soup was extremely delicate and my wife commented that this was one of the first times she really saw me trying to get every bit of soup onto my spoon.  I could go on but I will say they put a lot of effort into the presentation of each course.  The ascetic of modern fused with nature definitely comes through. You could even tell that the bowls and other serving ware were chosen because it seemed like they were molded with a woodsy pattern.  I'd give acadia a 4.5.                                 euroatheart.com,",Acadia,Chicago

3.3,"arly Valentines Dinner for Two. My husband Jeff and I had decided awhile ago to check out John & Tony's. Since I am on call all from 0800 Saturday until 0800 Sunday we decided to celebrate Valentines on the 13th. What a welcome surprise we found! The interior was very attractive and relaxing. Our waiter and busboy were both perfectly attentive although we did not hear about any specials that might have been options. Calamari was delicious, especially if you opted the garlic sauce on the side. Chicken with Rice soup had a nice depth of flavor. Salad was simple but very good as well. May suggest croutons made fresh in-house? Our steaks were perfectly aged, tender and full of flavor. Sides of Asparagus and Sauteed Mushrooms with Garlic were a delicious addition to the beef and the roasted red potatoes. So full we skipped coffee and dessert this time, we will try and save room next visit. Overall an excellent dining experience all around. The ONLY suggestion I can offer is serrated knives for the steaks, chops etc..... We will certainly be back and will highly recommend you to friends and family looking for and exceptional evening out! Great job guys! Christopher,",John & Tony's,Chicago

During the day we were searching for a place nearby that we could get gluten-free food, and Homeslice came up on our search. And, it was within walking distance!We arrived during happy hour and started with some delicious cider and the Jalepeno Homies which were grilled jalapenos stuffed with cheese and bacon and accompanied with BBQ sauce. The gluten-free pizza was delicious, and we loved their combinations of pizza as we ate the Lew-Wow and Mercenary! I also got their Buffalo Chicken salad (but subbed ranch instead of bleu cheese), which was great for a pizza place, being made with fresh spring greens, and lots of fresh veggies. We enjoyed this place so much, that we came back a second time during our 6 day trip to Chicago!                                                monikamcmahon.com,",Homeslice,Chicago
3.3,Overpriced for what you get. We ordered an appetizer platter. $26. They were out of onion rings so they replaced it with Mac and cheese. The past was significantly overcooked and fell apart on the fork. The sauce was somewhat flavorless. There were Bavarian style pretzels with excessive oregano and canned cheese for dipping. The spicy mustard was just odd-tasting. The buffalo wings were ok as were the corned beef sliders, (even though they weren't really sliders - just a quartered sandwich).  Add to that that a bottle of corona is $8 and I don't think we'll eat here again.,Kitty O'Shea's
