3.6,"Chicago has <n>great</n> and when people tell you about pizza it's always deep dish - but we really have more than that. While I love deep dish and there are a few other thin <n>thick crust pizza</n> places that I like slightly more -- when I want just a <n>slice</n> or two....or have some fun toppings this is the place to go! Also, if you're looking for a deal get their PB&J - Pizza, <p>Blue Ribbon</p> and <p>Jameson shot</p>! Speaking of Jameson---get the soft serve <p>ice cream</p> and if you are looking for something to up the game get <p> mac and cheese</p>, <p> hot coffee</p> <p>chocolate donuts</p> and <p> corn pancakes</p>! The best in the city...especially because you get <p>ice cream</p> to <n>dipped</n> them in! Yums!,",The Boiler Room,Chicago
