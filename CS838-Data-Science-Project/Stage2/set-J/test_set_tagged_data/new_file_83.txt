3.9,"I am not a dessert person, ask anyone. I prefer all things <n>savory</n> and my favorite <n>birthday</n> <p>chocolate cake</p> EVER was made entirely out of sushi. I don’t crave sweets, don’t mind life without <p>chocolate pie </p> and will take my <p>caramel</p> salted, thank you. In my food adventures, I have eaten fancy desserts, <p>fruit pastries</p> and <p>candies galore</p>. I usually take a couple of bites and then I am done. I opt for desserts that are fruit based and not very sweet.But there is one dessert that tempts me every time. It is like a siren call, almost completely irresistible. It is <p>frozen custard</p> and my favorite comes from Scooter’s in Chicago. Rich and creamy, this <p>custard fruit </p> is what ice cream WANTS to be when it grows up. At Scooter’s, custard is an art form. <p>Vanilla</p> and chocolate are always present. They have seasonal flavors (pumpkin in the fall is lovely!) and a ton of mix-ins available. Would you like a slice of <p>apple pie</p> mixed into your <p>custard pie</p>? <p>Chocolate chip cookie</p> dough? <p>Heath Bar</p>? <p>Banana milkshake</p>? There are as many favorite combos as there are people.True to form my favorite thing on the menu here is a <p>strawberry concrete</p>: velvety <p>vanilla custard</p> with fresh <p>strawberries and cranberries</p> mixed in. It is simple and simply brilliant. I think I am in love. I would eat one of those anytime. Yes, even in the dead of winter.{This review was originally published on April 7th, 2014},",Scooter's Frozen Custard,Chicago
