3.6,"A great place to sit outside and play hooky on a <n>gorgeous</n> Chicago afternoon! Enjoy their <p>craft cocktails</p> and some of their American-flared handhelds. The prices are typically Michigan Ave., but the service, portion sizes and food quality are always spot-on. Kick your meal off with their <n>golden</n> <p> hash brown</p> and delicious <p>Gourmet Tots</p> appetizer ($11), made with <p>smoked potatoes</p>, <p>prosciutto</p> and served with a <p>truffle crème fraîche</p>. They feature great <p> meatball burgers</p> - all 8ozs, starting at a pricey $15- and one of the best, most <n>flavorful</n> house-cured <p>pastrami sandwiches</p> ($15) in town. The <p>BBQ pork sliders</p> and <p>beef brisket</p> are decent, but I find their sauce to be far too <n>sweet</n> for my North Carolina tastebuds. And most folks swear by their <p>fried chicken sandwich</p>. Sides include <n>spicy</n> <p>coleslaw</p> and olive oil <p>parsley fries</p>. And you cannot beat the beer selection at their massive outdoor bar - but watch out for their Ghost Pepper Bloody Mary - it's a scorcher!,",Howells & Hood,All Reviews 13
