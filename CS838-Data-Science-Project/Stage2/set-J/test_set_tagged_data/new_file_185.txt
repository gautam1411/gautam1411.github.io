3.7,"We stopped in last night after work for drinks and appetizers. I was disappointed they haven't jumped on the Happy Hour train yet and they didn't have any specials. But I really liked the cocktail I ordered, the Mistress - a cool, <n>refreshing</n> <p>grapefruit flavored drink</p>. If you like grapefruit, you'll love this cocktail. My husband got the <p>Blueberry Vandermill Cider</p> and got a free <p>State Lake cookie</p> with each can.For food we tried the <p>Fried Poutine</p>, <p>Pimento Cheese Dip</p> with Chips, and Soft <p>Pretzel with Red Pepper</p> and <p>Goat Cheese Dip</p>. The Poutine came with bacon and peas and was super cheesy and delicious, not <n>weighed</n> down in gravy like Poutine can be. The <p>Pimento Dip<\p> was good, but far and away, the real winner was the pretzel with goat cheese and red pepper dip. It tasted like a <p>jalapeno popper</p> without being fried, and the pretzel was crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside. I don't usually like goat cheese, but I loved this. And the presentation of all the dishes was creative. The only downside was the service. Apparently we got caught in a shift change and had quite the time trying to track someone down to pay our bill (like 20+ minutes of waiting for someone give our money to). Luckily the food and drinks were on point, so this didn't sully our experience too much.                                windycity-wanderlust.blogspot.com,",State and Lake Chicago Tavern,Chicago
