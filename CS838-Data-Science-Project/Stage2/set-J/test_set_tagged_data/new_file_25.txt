3.6,"Excellent small plates for <n>sharing</n>. I particularly <n>enjoyed</n> the <p>grilled squid</p>, <p>skirt steak</p> w/ <p>spicy kimchi</p> and <p>trumpet mushrooms</p>. The <p>chicken wings</p> and twice-fried were also great, esp. with the <n>accompanying</n> sauces. We ordered a <p>top ramen</p> to share among four people - the broth was rich and full of flavour. Overall, <p>cheesy Yusho</p> was a <n>really</n> positive eating experience. However, the cocktails were <n>disappointing</n>. I opted for The Classic"," with <p>Japanese whisky</p>, soda, and lemon. It came out as a <n>watery</n> whisky, with <n>little</n> flavour, a <n>huge</n> disappointment at $15. The second round wasn't <n>much</n> better though there was one cocktail with an egg white that everyone at the table <n>loved</n>, myself included!                                                krismlars.com",Yusho
