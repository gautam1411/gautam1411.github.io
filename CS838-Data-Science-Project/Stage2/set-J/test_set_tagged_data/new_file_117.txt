3.9,"It's a really upbeat place with courteous staff and fresh food options and pretty pocket friendly for the quantity! So they give you a bowl with stick on which you are supposed to write your name. I think they have different bowls for lunch and dinner, the lunch one being smaller. You get variety of buffet options, mostly Asian to choose from. The only catch is they let you select only one protein, which you need to write in a piece of sheet stuck to the stick with your name. Will visit it again!,",Flat Top Grill,All Reviews´è__9
