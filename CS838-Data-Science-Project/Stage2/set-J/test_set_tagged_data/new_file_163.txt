3.7,"I love Union, but not for the sushi. I love it for the <p>spicy hot barbeque</p>. This is definitely a <n>trendy</n> spot. Union has a <n>plethora</n> of delicious options and happy hour specials that CANNOT be beat ($1 oysters, $2 <p>beef skewers</p>, and $4 shrimp <p>tempura rolls</p>). The way they dress their oysters is <n>really</n> delicious. Other dishes I've tried include: <p>truffled tuna</p> - good but <n>overbearingly</n> <n>truffly</n>",", prosciutto <p>wrapped roll</p> <n>cheesy scallop</n> - how could you go wrong here?, bbq califlower - omg this is my <n>favorite</n> thing on the menu, and many delicious and <n>creative</n> cocktails. Another thing that seems to be popular is <n>subbing</n> <p>black rice</p> into your sushi. <n>Looking</n> forward to going back.",Union Sushi + Barbeque Bar
