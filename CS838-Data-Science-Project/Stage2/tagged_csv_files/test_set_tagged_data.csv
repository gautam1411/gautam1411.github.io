3.1,"Bar Takito is a sister restaurant to Takito Kitchen in Wicker Park. Located right beside the Morgan el stop in the West Loop, Bar Takito has a large sidewalk patio seating area, and a spacious interior with two bars. The space is <n>bright</n> and <n>colorful</n> and has lots of seating.The menu features <p>Mexican Burritos</p>, <n>Central</n>, and <n>American</n> food with a modern twist. This isn’t the type of place that serves guacamole. Instead they specialize in more unique offerings inspired by seasonal ingredients.We started with the Chorizo & Chicken Arepa. An arepa is a <p>corn pancake</p>, and at Bar Takito it has whole kernels of corn. It was then topped with <p>grilled mushrooms</p>, <p>pickled vegetables</p>, <p>vegetarian chorizo</p>, <p>chicken breast</p>, and an <p>aji peanut sauce</p>.The chicken was <n>fried</n> in large pieces, while the chorizo was finely <n>chopped</n>. I really enjoyed the <p>arepa and sauce</p> , but I think that there was a little too much going on here. Next time I would order the <p>Vegetarian Arepa</p> instead.Next up, two orders of <p>tacos</p>. Takito is known for it’s tacos and they lived up to the hype. The menu includes four different types of tacos, which are served in orders of three. We chose to try the <p>Brunkow Cheese</p> and <p>Coffee Braised Beef tacos</p>.The <p>Brunkow Cheese Tacos</p> came with a large piece of <p>grilled brunkow cheese</p>, <p>pickled jicama</p>, <p>arugula</p>, <p>salty peanuts</p>, <p>ahi peanut sauce</p>, and a slice of avocado.

The unagi roll was yummy, but I am a huge fan of eel and the sweet <p>eel sauce</p>.  The spicy <p>tuna roll</p> was a familiar roll, similar to every other sushi place.  But there is nothing wrong with that.  Our service was great, the waiters brought the food out as it was ready very promptly.  So far it was a wonderful experience, the only bad part was the owner/manager(not sure who she was, she alluded to owning the place in her conversation) spent half our meal with her butt in our face.  She apparently knew the couple at the next table well and got into a deep conversation with them about their daughter and her shared love of jumping horses with the couple. Yes she was close enough that I could have been included in the conversation as well.  I either could stare at my dinner partner or the kitchen, looking outside wasn't an option because she was standing right next to me, <n>facing</n> the couple, and have her conversation.

My daughters <p>cheese pizza</p> was burnt and I requested another one, the Manager Dave, came to our table to confront me in an argumentative manor telling me the pizza was not burnt, that is the way they serve their <p>amaerican pizzas</p>. My pizza was not burnt and when I pointed that out to him he became angry and said, he could not explain that one, but the <p>cheese pizza</p> was not burnt. It was burnt all around. I told Dave, fine we will just take it I didn't want to argue, Dave then said, No the pizza is mine now.... and jerked the pizza out of my hands and borderline assaulted me. What a professional Manager...(not) Dave must have told the kitchen not to make the rest of our order because we sat there waiting for it. We had to ask for the remade <p>cheese sandwich</p> and my friends little pizzas. Needless to say, I will never go back to Silo unless they hire professional Managers and servers. The food was not good enough to endure those types of attitudes.,",Silo Restaurant,Chicago

The past was significantly overcooked and fell apart on the fork. The sauce was somewhat flavorless. There were Bavarian style pretzels with <n>excessive</n> oregano and canned cheese for dipping. The spicy mustard was just odd-tasting. The buffalo wings were ok as were the corned beef sliders, (even though they weren't really sliders - just a quartered sandwich).  Add to that that a bottle of corona is $8 and I don't think we'll eat here again.,Kitty O'Shea's

The lamb stew was excellent and worth a return, as was the corned beef and cabbage. However, the fish was <n>dreadfully</n> bad. Almost all breading, very greasy, no fish flavor. 3 of us at the table had fish and chips and all agreed it was basically <n>inedible</n>. The kids had <p>steak hamburgers</p> and they were pleased.

Not only that, I got a seemingly simple pie in the <p>banana creme</p> but it exceeded mine and all my guests expectations.  I'm not sure how you could make a pie better than that and I'll probably be back for any of my pie related needs. The only thing is that this location is pretty much a take out only store. There is a single table but I wouldn't count on it being available at any given time.  To sum up, get a Hoosier Mama to impress at your next party.

4.2,"We stopped in at the Bar on Buena (BOB) on the 4th of July. It was one of the only restaurants open on the 4th in the Uptown area and came highly recommended from a friend we were with. The 4th was a <n>beautiful</n> day and the BOB had <n>seating</n> that has a perfect mix. The BOB was serving a strict brunch-only menu until 3 pm, which was fine because some of us wanted breakfast food, but when a friend asked if they could order their favorite menu item, a simple <p>grilled cheese</p> and <p> chocolate donuts</p>, the waitress flat out refused. This was the first of the dismal service we experienced while there. Our waitress was outright <n>rude</n> at times (possibly because she was working on a <n>holiday</n>?) and when someone in our party went to the bar to ask for a pen, she was <n>ignored</n> by several staffers who were <n>standing</n> around talking, for several minutes.Luckily, I often find it's the company that makes the experience, so we still had a good time and enjoyed the basic fare. Two of us ordered the Brunch <p>Torta with scrambled egg</p>, <p>baked beans</p>, and <p>cheese sandwich</p> (what could have easily been a <p>grilled cheese</p> if fried, just saying), which was ginormous and filling, if not bland (thank god for <p>siracha sauce</p>). The best thing about this meal was <n>honestly</n> the flavorful <p>jalapeno rice</p> and <p>baked beans</p>. My husband ordered the <p>Tres Leches French Toast</p>, which sounded <n>fancier</n> than they actually were. We also had several brunch <p>polish beers</p> and <p>korean wine</p> while there and the BOB seemed to be well-stocked.Overall, I'd give the BOB another chance to try out their dinner menu if in the neighborhood again, but would have little expectations for the service.                                windycity-wanderlust.blogspot.com,",The Bar on Buena,Chicago

3.7,"We stopped in last night after work for drinks and appetizers. I was disappointed they haven't jumped on the Happy Hour train yet and they didn't have any specials. But I really liked the cocktail I ordered, the Mistress - a cool, <n>refreshing</n> <p>grapefruit flavored drink</p>. If you like grapefruit, you'll love this cocktail. My husband got the <p>Blueberry Vandermill Cider</p> and got a free <p>State/Lake coosie</p> with each can.For food we tried the <p>Fried Poutine</p>, <p>Pimento Cheese Dip</p> with Chips, and Soft <p>Pretzel with Red Pepper</p> and <p>Goat Cheese Dip</p>. The Poutine came with bacon and peas and was super <n>cheesy</n> and delicious, not <n>weighed</n> down in gravy like Poutine can be. The <p>Pimento Dip</p> was good, but far and away, the real winner was the pretzel with goat cheese and red pepper dip. It tasted like a <p>jalapeno popper</p> without being fried, and the pretzel was crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside. I don't usually like goat cheese, but I loved this. And the presentation of all the dishes was creative. The only downside was the service. Apparently we got caught in a shift change and had quite the time trying to track someone down to pay our bill (like 20+ minutes of waiting for someone give our money to). Luckily the food and drinks were on point, so this didn't sully our experience too much.                                windycity-wanderlust.blogspot.com,",State and Lake Chicago Tavern,Chicago

Last night was our third attempt to visit this place as they were closed for the season a while ago and a storm had affected their gelato making abilities last week.  Well worth the wait though.I believe Black Dog is cash only so plan accordingly.  Once you're inside you'll see they have about a dozen or so flavors but each one is really unique.

I went with the unexpectedly <n>satisfying</n> sweet corn mixed with a classic cookies n creme.  Probably a weird flavor mix but who cares it was great <p>creamy gelato</p>.

It seems a little suspect; they have an array of burgers, all with a ton of craaaaazy, wild shit on them, but the standout one, The Lockdown Warden, is all leeks and cheese. I_¥Ë_¥Ë_m on board with that. I like leeks. Not to mention the <p>caramel cheese</p>. Although the restaurant_¥Ë_¥Ë_s website is full of a bunch of metal images and it_¥Ë_¥Ë_s <n>emblazoned</n> with the Iron Maiden logo, I feel like if a restaurant is brave enough to do something with leeks on a burger, I should go.A cascade of Freddie Mercuries greet me on three televisions as I walk in.

When the folks at Parts & Labor invited me in to tried to <n>offer</n> me food. I couldn’t say no to eating out in one of my favorite <n>neighborhoods</n>. Do try their <p> Chicken salads </p> and <p> fruit salads </p>                                               ...Read full post on betterthanramen.net,",Parts and Labor,All Reviews 6
3.8,"Mexican food lover. I purchased a <p>chicken burrito</p> meal to go. Right off the bat, i thought it was <n>pricey</n> ($13.95). The rice and beans portions were small. They only filled half the compartment of the take out tray. The burrito was bland. It had no seasoning, no flavor, very little taste. There was no lettuce and very little tomatoes. I cannot recommend this dinner and will not go there again. Bottomline - overpriced and blah food.The restaurant would be a wonderful place for a date. It's very dark and cozy. So i would suggest going there for a date, have a few <p>chilled margueritas</p>, don't buy the food.For good mexican food, try blue Agave on w maple st, chicago.,",La Cantina Grill,Chicago
4.2,"With as large of a burger selection they have at Palmer Place, one could eat there every day for a month and still not experience all that they have on the menu.  And the menu at Palmer Place doesn't just stop at the burgers, they have some other <n>interesting</n> items on the menu that I would like to try including their signature <p>corned beef sandwich</p>.  The beer selection was top notch, I felt the service was fine and efficient, and I liked the atmosphere in Palmer Place.

3.7,"A really <n>pretentious</n> place. Server was <n>inattentive</n> and came off as rude. Ordered the <p>egg white omelette</p> which says had <p>turkey</p> and <p>avocado</p>; one piece of <n>tiny</n> <p>famous avocado</p> on a <n>giant</n> <p>turkey filled omelette</p> made it <n>bland</n> and <n>tasteless</n>. Ordered a side of <p>hash browns</p> that was <n>overcooked</n> and <n>charred</n>. A <n>refreshing</n> restaurant name, but doesn't live up to it.,",Summer House Santa Monica,Chicago
4.0,"I haven't eaten inside the restaurant, but we've gotten takeout from here many times. Could not possibly give it anything other than 5 stars. The crust is paper thin, so when they say no more than 3 toppings, they MEAN it. We love the '<p>nduja pizza</p>, which was a spicy, <p>spreadable sausage</p> that <n>blew</n> our minds. For takeout, they gave us a cup of <p>fried basil</p> to put on at home, and the combination of the <p>sweet basil</p>, <p>spicy sausage</p>, and <p>tangy sauce</p> was unreal. The <p>pepperoni pizza</p> and <p>grilled ricotta</p> is also <n>fabulous</n>. I cannot wait to take my family to this restaurant and to try more!,",Coalfire,Chicago
3.9,"<n>Wonderful</n>. I love <p>pizza napoletana</p>. I love the <n>chewy</n> crust and crispy edges. Frankie's makes great pizza. Unfortunately I have no idea why I ordered the type of pizza I did - I HATE truffles, therefore I hate <p>truffle oil</p>. So of course I ordered a pizza with truffle oil. Duh! That being said, Frankie's was able to take an ingredient I despise and make it <n>tolerable</n>. That's magic. One complaint - I ordered the <p>arugula salad</p> which is served with olive oil and lemon. That being said they needed to use the sale shaker a bit - or at least put one on the table. The Granda Padano didn't offer enough salt for what was a huge salad. Service was ok - he just seemed to realize his time was best spent with tables of more than one person. I guess I don't blame him. Overall <n>pretty</n> good.,",Frankie's Pizzeria & Scaloppine,Chicago

3.9,"It's a really upbeat place with <n>courteous</n> staff and fresh food options and pretty pocket friendly for the quantity! So they give you a bowl with stick on which you are supposed to write your name. I think they have different <n>bowls</n> for lunch and dinner, the lunch one being smaller. You get variety of buffet options, mostly Asian to choose from. The only catch is they let you select only one protein, which you need to write in a piece of sheet stuck to the stick with your name.

3.7,"We stopped in last night after work for drinks and appetizers. I was disappointed they haven't jumped on the Happy Hour train yet and they didn't have any specials. But I really liked the cocktail I ordered, the Mistress - a cool, <n>refreshing</n> <p>grapefruit flavored drink</p>. If you like grapefruit, you'll love this cocktail. My husband got the <p>Blueberry Vandermill Cider</p> and got a free <p>State Lake cookie</p> with each can.For food we tried the <p>Fried Poutine</p>, <p>Pimento Cheese Dip</p> with Chips, and Soft <p>Pretzel with Red Pepper</p> and <p>Goat Cheese Dip</p>. The Poutine came with bacon and peas and was super cheesy and delicious, not <n>weighed</n> down in gravy like Poutine can be. The <p>Pimento Dip<\p> was good, but far and away, the real winner was the pretzel with goat cheese and red pepper dip. It tasted like a <p>jalapeno popper</p> without being fried, and the pretzel was crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside. I don't usually like goat cheese, but I loved this. And the presentation of all the dishes was creative. The only downside was the service. Apparently we got caught in a shift change and had quite the time trying to track someone down to pay our bill (like 20+ minutes of waiting for someone give our money to). Luckily the food and drinks were on point, so this didn't sully our experience too much.                                windycity-wanderlust.blogspot.com,",State and Lake Chicago Tavern,Chicago

The food is better than average bar food (especially the <p>crispy nachos</p> and <p>grilled cheese</p>) which makes it a great weeknight destination.

3.6,"WORST RESTAURANT IN PALOS. This is the <n>worst</n> restaurant I have ever been too, for food and service. I would not recommend this to my enemies. The only one good thing was sitting on the roof. When we first got there one of the members of our group ordered a glass of <p>White Zin</p>, it was the color of <p>apple cider vinegar</p> and so was the taste, it was sent back. My husband and I ordered a bottle of <p>red wine</p> and each of us requested a <p>glass of ice</p> to go with it. My husband got a glass of ice, I did not. We then ordered <p>black calamari</p> as an appetizer. It was brought to our table, but none of us had utensils or napkins, so it sat for five minutes until someone could get us utensils. I asked for a glass of ice again. Still don't have it after ten minutes. We then place our food order. Two diners ordered <p>chicken salad</p> and four of us ordered <p>meso soup</p>. Two diners received their salad and one diner received their soup. The other three of us assumed our soup we be brought out immediately after theirs. Finally our dinners come, we tell them three of us are still waiting for our soup. We told the we would take it to go. I then asked for my glass of ice. Two diners had the <p>smoked salmon</p>, which they said was okay and another diner had the <p>hot steak</p> which he said was good. One of the other diners had <p>Eggplant Parmesan</p> which she said was extremely <n>soggy</n>. Another diner had the <p>Rigatoni Caprese</p>, which had not taste and the <p>pasta noodle</p> was overcooked. I had the <p>Lemon Chicken</p>, which needed seasoning, I normally do not use salt and this really needed it. The plate was very white, the angel hair <p>pasta sauce</p> was overcooked. We finally got our check and I received my glass of ice. We never did receive our soups to take home. DO NOT GO HERE TO EAT!! The view was nice but that is the only thing that is worth it. If you want really GREAT Italian food, go one block south to Capri, it is the BEST!!! I wouldn't waste my time or money to go here again even if they have a nice view.,","Sam Buca's Restaurant, Bar and Rooftop",Chicago

3.6,"I'll be honest, this was a place I've been wanting to try for a long time & wanted to love...but that just did not happen. I'll reveal why as you read on...or IF you read on.I ordered the <p>black bean burger</p> with a <p>side salad</p> and <p> Hot chocolate </p> & it was surprisingly good. If you're a normal <p>veggie burger</p> eater than you know its hard to find one that doesn't completely fall into a million pieces after the first bite...that did not happen & was lovely. It's strange but the amount of <p>avocado</p> I was given was way too much. My boyfriend ordered the <p>southwest omelet</p> & <n>enjoyed</n> it aside from the <p>chorizo</p> tasting more like <p>hamburger meat</p> than chorizo.My first complaint came from the rather rushed service that still left my <p>cold coffee</p> empty for quite some time. And while we're talking about coffee...my biggest complaint is that once I drank my mug to the bottom I noticed an old coffee ring that had been left inside from prior use. It easily rubbed off with my finger which tells me the <n>glass</n> was not washed. It left me feeling quite ill.Also, it's cash only. But they do offer an ATM inside.,",Jam 'n Honey,Chicago
3.8,"Disappointing. Both our entrees were underdone. No excuse for an expensive steak house. They added some crab to <p>French fries</p> and called it a dish. Really??

I ordered the <p>boneless short rib</p>, it tasted great but the piece of meat was actually higher up on the chuck and for $27 . ( I know my cuts of meat having helped my father for years in his meat market) it was expensive pot roast. The side of <p>roasted corn</p> was good.
