I am honestly disappointed with her, while the rest of the staff is pleasant. She is Caucasian, wears glasses, short hair tied in a pony tail, tattoos on her arms, and medium build.

The 4th was a <n>beautiful</n> day and the BOB had <n>sidewalk</n> <n>seating</n> that has a perfect mix of <n>sun</n> and <n>shade</n>. The BOB was serving a strict brunch-only menu until 3 pm, which was fine because some of us wanted breakfast food, but when a friend asked if they could order their favorite menu item, a simple <p>grilled cheese</p>, the waitress flat out refused. This was the first of the dismal service we experienced while there. Our waitress was outright <n>rude</n> at times (possibly because she was working on a <n>holiday</n>?) and when someone in our party went to the bar to ask for a pen, she was ignored by several staffers who were standing around talking, for several minutes.Luckily, I often find it's the company that makes the experience, so we still had a good time and enjoyed the basic fare. Two of us ordered the Brunch <p>Torta with scrambled egg</p>, <p>guac</p>, and <p>cheese sandwich</p> (what could have easily been a grilled cheese if fried, just saying), which was ginormous and filling, if not bland (thank god for <p>siracha sauce</p>).

3.4,"Went there for dinner without any reservations and was able to be seated immediately. By the size of the dining room and the number of seats, I could imagine this place getting pretty busy at times. We ordered the <p>pork belly steam bun</p> and <p>chicken steam bun</p> as appetizers. Both were wonderfully tender, tasty, and <n>juicy</n>. The sauces and flavor profiles for each of the buns was great. The pork belly was so tender and the <p>kimchi pickles</p> on the pork bun was not too spicy or <p>kimchi funky</p>. The mixture of <p>mayo</p> and some other hoisen/<p>BBQ sauce</p> on the <p>chicken steam</p> bun made it really original. Onto the main course, <p>veggie ramen</p> and <p>Fatty Ramen</p>"," (the day's special). Both had wonderfully deep, rich broths. My Fatty Ramen dish was a bit tastier since the <p>broth</p> was a little bit <n>thicker</n> and almost <n>creamy</n>. The pork belly was wonderfully tender with crispness on the outside that really added a nice texture when combined with the <p>schezewan noodles</p>. I wish they would have separated the <p>bok choi</p> rather than keeping it in tact within the dish. It was a bit awkward trying to separate the leaves so I could have just one leaf with each bite of noodles. The veggie ramen dish was ordered with <p>fried garlic</p> which added a wonderful flavor. The <p>roasted eggplant</p> in the dish, just soaked in all the flavor from the broth making it so delicious. We saved room for desert and opted for the <p>chocolate doughnuts</p> with <p>vanilla cream sauce</p>. This is what doughnut holes should be. Each morsel, dunked in the <p>cream sauce</p> was to die for. Even though each bit sized <p>cheese morsel</p> was covered in <p>brown sugar</p>, adding the cream sauce did not make it too <n>sweet</n>. I do have a sweet tooth though.

The latkes come with <p>sour cream</p> AND <p>spicy applesauce</p>, so you don't have to choose or you can share (not that you'll want to, but still...)! The half sandwich of <p>corned beef</p> on <p>seeded rye</p> is the size of a full sandwich, and is served hot and juicy.

3.8,"Mexican food lover. I purchased a <p>chicken burrito</p> meal to go. Right off the bat, i thought it was <n>pricey</n> ($13.95). The rice and beans portions were small. They only filled half the compartment of the take out tray. The burrito was bland. It had no seasoning, no flavor, very little taste. There was no lettuce and very little tomatoes. I cannot recommend this dinner and will not go there again. Bottomline - overpriced and blah food.The restaurant would be a wonderful place for a date. It's very dark and cozy. So i would suggest going there for a date, have a few <p>chilled margueritas</p>, don't buy the food.For good mexican food, try blue Agave on w maple st, chicago.,",La Cantina Grill,Chicago

3.9,"<p>Craft beer</p> excellence paired with delicious food. This place is expanding <n>rapidly</n> with the addition of brewery tanks, coffee bar, and retail store. The atmosphere is reminiscent of a European beer hall. Awesome selection of Two Brothers beers all on tap. I found the dinner menu to be very creative; much better than I expected. I opted for three small plates which was plenty of food: <p>Chicken Kebabs</p> (<p>milk zucchini</p>, mushroom, red onion, <p>bell pepper</p> over <p>basil walnut rice</p>); Grouper (<p>blackened snowy grouper</p>, sweet bacon hash, <p>sage beurre Blane</p>); and <p>bison meatballs</p>, <p>north wind cherry BBQ sauce</p>, and <p>zucchini slaw</p>.

3.8,"Yum yum yum yum... Just went here for brunch and since its a week day, there was no crowd. We love brunch and were not disappointed by the selection, quality or speed of the food. For your entrees, you can choose as your side: <p>mini pancakes</p>, <p>mini waffles</p> or toast. Pancake and waffle selection for minis include the specialty pancakes/waffles like <p>strawberry rhubarb</p>, <p>banana dulce de leche</p> and <p>cinnamon roll</p>...so good and minis are actually quite big. We also had a <p>veggie skillet</p>, meaty omelette, and <p>sweet potato hash</p> with <p>scrambled eggs</p>. Coffee is a bit expensive but its Intelligentsia for us coffee snobs.

3.7,"A smattering <n>pricey</n> for the portion sizes – from the wine pours to entrées - but we would certainly try them again, especially since they’re in our neighborhood (…but only after they fix the air conditioning.) We started off with cocktails <p> blue lagoon</p>, including the <p>Armeni-tini</p> ($11) a light and <n>refreshing</n> <p>pomegranate tequila cocktail</p> and <p>vodka martini</p>, and the <p>Fried Chili Idli</p> ($10), a <p> honey sweet tart</p> and <n>mildly</n> <p>chile vodka concoction</p>, served up with a huge sprig of <p>cheesy quesedia</p>. Certainly <p>craft drinks</p> worthy of the price.We started with the <p>Mezza Sampler</p>, which was delivered mere seconds after ordering. The long, three-sectioned plate featured labneh – a “<p>farmer’s cheese dip</p>”- which tasted like <n>plain</n> <p>cream cheese</p> with a <p>fruity olive oil drizzle</p> and a light dusting of <p>paprika pizza</p>. There were two <n>ice cold coffee</n>, but <n>flavorful</n>, <p>yalanchi sarma</p> - <p>grape leaves</p> <n>stuffed raisins</n> with <p>raisin bran</p>, <p>almonds</p> and <p>chopped herbs</p>. The trio was rounded out with a decent portion of <p>baba ghannouj</p>, the <n>famously</n> <n>roasted</n> <p>eggplant dip</p>, all served with a basket of <p>rocket hot fries</p> <p>pita bread</p>. For $10.95, the offering was a decent way for two people to sample some of their traditional fare.The dining space itself is long and very (very) dark, with several small, semicircular cubby-holes that easily seat two, maybe three, with a third chair. On a recent Saturday night, the back of the room had been set up for a table of 20 when we arrive, but during our 90 minute meal, there were only about a dozen people in the restaurant. There were a few dining tables outside, and the bar can easily seat six to eight people. The bathrooms are down a steep flight of stairs, and were absolutely spotless. One thing we noticed half way through our dining was the temperature in the restaurant was rising rather quickly – despite being directly under an airduct, we could feel no air flowing. Some of the guests around us pointed out the room’s temperature to their waiters, and it sounded like the restaurant was having some problems with their air conditioning.  Feeling the heat, we opted for a glass of the <p>Armenian wine</p> ($9), a fresh and <n>fruity</n> pomegranate-based red, and a glass of one of their summer special <p>white wine</p>, a Pierre et Papa ($9) – sadly, the pours in the small <p>goblets of fire nuggets</p> were rather miserly for the money.Much like the appetizers, our entrees arrived very quickly after ordering – the <p>shish kabobs</p> ($20.95) featured perfectly seared cubes of herbaceous lamb, cooked to exactly medium rare and sporting a nice, evenly charred crust. The flavors were spot-on, but the bed of white rice underneath was utterly flavorless. Our second entree, the Armenian Combo –was billed as “a generous serving of <p>spicy sarma</p>, <p>baked boereg</p>, <p>hara kufta</p> and eggplant”, but was woefully lacking in generosity at $17.95. The three piece sarma (<p>stuffed grape leaves</p>) were stuffed with <p>minced meat</p> and spices, unfortunately they were covered in a rather tasteless, <n>cheese-like</n> sauce we couldn’t identify. The kufta, a lone, golf ball-sized meatball, was nicely flavored with spices and came swimming in a lemony cream sauce. The boereg was the only real stand out – a perfectly crispy filo-wrapped portion of spinach and cheese. The roasted eggplant was nothing more than a non-pureed version of their baba ghannouj. By now, it was rather stifling inside the restaurant due to the lack of airflow, so instead of ordering desserts and coffee, we opted for our check – just over $104.00, before tip.,",Sayat-Nova,All Reviews 20
