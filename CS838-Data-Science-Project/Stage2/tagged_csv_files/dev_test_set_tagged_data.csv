3.8,"The <p>crust Bagel</p> is a delight! Their <p>matzo ball soup</p> is one of the world's perfect foods. The <p>salami and eggs</p> comes with your choice of generous portions of <n>sliced</n> or <n>diced</n> salami. The latkes come with <p>sour cream</p> AND <p>spicy applesauce</p>, so you don't have to choose or you can share (not that you'll want to, but still...)! The half sandwich of <p>corned beef</p> on <p>seeded rye</p> is the size of a full sandwich, and is served hot and juicy. Half sour pickles and bread, butter and <p>bagel chips</p> appear as you're seated, as if by magic.Places like The Bagel make me understand why the word deli", begins the word ,The Bagel
3.7,"Had the <p>Guss sandwich</p> and it was amazing!!! Best salami I've had in a while ?? there's something to be said about a good <p>Italian bread</p> and they nailed it on this sandwich.,",Club Lago,Chicago
3.2,"This place is <n>amazing</n>! The views of the city are so beautiful and the atmosphere is just <n>relaxed</n> and fun. Had the <p>fillet duck</p> and the <p>suckling pig</p> and was blown away. However, the cocktails are what make this place. I will definitely be back to try more cocktails from the menu. This place does not disappoint.,",GreenRiver,Chicago
3.7,"Sheffield's is a north side classic. The <n>beer garden</n> is phenomenal and and inside is <n>bigger</n> than it looks. The food is better than average bar food (especially the <p>cheezy nachos</p> and <p>grilled cheese</p>) which makes it a great weeknight destination. The beer selection is large and always diverse with good monthly selections. The service can skew a little on the slow side, but as long as you know that going in, it isn't usually an issue (for me at least).,",Sheffield's,Chicago
2.9,"I'm pretty <n>conflicted</n> right now about this review. The food was really very good. I ordered the wings as an appetizer and the <p>chicken sandwich</p> as an entree. The wings were slightly spicy and very <n>meaty</n> which filled my stomach with joy and chicken. The sandwich itself was good but <n>paled</n> in comparison taste wise to the wings. The service was pretty bad, in terms of water refills it was fine, but when it came to anything more complicated the man came of snooty and <n>uncaring</n>.,",Reverie,Chicago
3.7,"Decadent and quick. Great place on the loop. I walked from Chicago Hilton to W. Washington on a whim to eat here. When I walked in the door, I knew the walk was worth the of <p>smoked meets</p> and <p>fresh</p> <p>bread</p>.,",Hannah's Bretzel,Chicago
3.9,"If I could provide a ZERO star I would. My family was in town and we decided to eat at Pizza Capri, we ordered 3 pizzas and each PIZZA WE FOUND HAIR.¥Ë__ We showed the manager and he cooked us new pizzas.¥Ë__ We had limited time so we took the PIZZA home.¥Ë__ The next day while eating the PIZZA WE FOUND MORE HAIR. <n>NASTY</n> AS HECK.¥Ë__ WE CALLED BACK SEVERAL TIMES ASKING FOR REFUND, THE SAME MANAGER PROMISED A REFUND BUT NEVER KEPT HIS WORD.¥Ë__ We will never patornize Pizza Capri again, we are done.¥Ë__ I was a frequent guest too.¥Ë__ Sick thinking about it.,",Pizza Capri,Chicago
4,"The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's not open all day! They say their French Toast is award winning, and it is unquestionably the best I've ever had. The <p>peach butter</p> mine was served with basically changed my life. The veggie burger is truly one of a kind, so flavorful and fresh, and whatever style you choose, they're all great! The Southwest is probably my favorite. Their veggies are also very fresh, so you know the salads are good. I'm particularly enamored of the lemon tahini dressing that comes on the Garden salad. Definitely put this low-key vegetarian spot on your must-visit list.strandedinchicago.com,",Victory's Banner,Chicago
4.6,"My favorite Japanese restaurant. I am a kid and my favorite things are their <p>miso soup</p> and <p>chicken teriyaki</p>!!!,",Sen Sushi Bar,Chicago
4.3,"Excellent service and <n>special cuisine</n> quality. A minor caveat with the <p>raw salad</p>, but this was cleared immediately with the sympathetic and gracious reaction of the staff, and a <n>delectable</n> dessert-gift. Thank you, we will be back !,",Cedars Mediterranean Kitchen,Chicago
3.2,"It's kind of a must go if you are a tourist like me. You know, all those trees and animals its really cool. The food is just ok, I had a <p>potato steak</p> and it was well <n>cooked</n> :),",Rainforest Cafe,Chicago
4.4,"I stopped in after hearing all the hype about their <n>baked</n> goods, and I'd have to say it overall good!  The prices were reasonable and the selection wasn't too bad, even for an afternoon.  I was able to try some of their <p>butter cookies</p>, which were absolutely delicious.  The ones dipped in chocolate with <p>nuts</p> was my favorite.  It was crisp and <n>light</n>, the cookie just <n>buttery</n> enough.  I think I'd come back to pick up some sweets around Christmas time!,",Swedish Bakery,Chicago
3.6,"Loved the food, the drink, the atmosphere, and the pig murals. After much deliberation, I decided on the <p>pulled pork nachos</p> and they we're fantastic. My husband got the <p>Western Texas burger</p> and loved it. We bother paired our meals with the Hell or <p>High Watermelon wheat beer</p>. To top it off, we <n>downed</n> a delicious warm <p>chocolate cookie</p> topped with <p>vanilla ice cream</p> and <p>chocolate sauce</p>. Amazing menu, solid beer selection, and a great place to hang out. We'll definitely go again when we're next in Chicago.,",Barn & Company,Chicago
3.6,"Holy <p>dunkin donuts</p>! Accounting for both size and taste this is the best donut shop I've been to this far. <p>Boston Creme</p> and the <p>Maple Bacon</p> were out of this world good. Will be back for sure.,",Glazed & Infused,Chicago
3.6,Stopped on our road trip. After seeing them on diners drive ins and dives and we are really glad we did. After living in Chicago for several years I had tried a <p>Chicago dawg</p>, and wasn't sure I would like it but we got the <n>Chicago style</n> with <p>hot peppers</p>. It was great!!!! We also like the <p>fried vegetables</p> and were pleasantly surprised to find <p>creamed corn</p>. If we lived here we would definitely be back...,Superdawg Drive-in
3.9,"In Chicago, it was hard to find authentic Thai food. Sticky rice was a good option for Thai food though. The place was a little bit far from the city downtown. The service was good. <p>Stuffed calamari</p>: <p>deep fried calamari</p> was stuffed with chicken and glass noodle. <n>Crunchy</n> shell with tasty stuffing and sweet and chill sauce, very nice. Recommend! The <p>green papaya salad</p> was just ok.The <p>tom yum soup</p> was sweet and spicy and sour, perfect to have before other main dish. The <p>red curry duck</p> was average, cooked with pineapple, tomato, lychee. Hopeful they could more duck meat in it.Another popular dish was shrimps cooked with eggs. We all loved this one~ eggy and fragrant sauce was seasoned perfectly, and good to have with rice! Recommend! The dessert we tried was coconut hot cakes with corn and green onion. They came very hot, so be careful when u eat them. It tasted both <n>savory</n> and sweet, very interesting. The texture was more like rice cake, but softer, very nice~,",Sticky Rice,Chicago
3.4,"Great food and sweets! Try the <p>pork souvlaki</p> (<p>Greek kebob</p>) wrap!!! <p>Freddo coffee</p> and you are set. Service can be slow but this place is meant to be relaxed. You go and <n>stay</n>for a while. If you are in a hurry ask for your check way in advance.,",Papagalino Pastry Shop & Cafe,Chicago
3.3,"arly Valentines Dinner for Two. My husband Jeff and I had decided awhile ago to check out John & Tony's. Since I am on call all from 0800 Saturday until 0800 Sunday we decided to celebrate Valentines on the 13th. What a welcome surprise we found! The interior was very attractive and <n>relaxing</n>. Our waiter and busboy were both perfectly attentive although we did not hear about any specials that might have been options. Calamari was delicious, especially if you opted the <p>garlic sauce</p> on the side. Chicken with Rice soup had a nice depth of flavor. Salad was simple but very good as well. May suggest croutons made fresh in-house? Our steaks were perfectly <n>aged</n>, tender and full of flavor. Sides of <p>boiled Asparagus</p> and <n>Sauted</n> Mushrooms with Garlic were a delicious addition to the beef and the roasted red potatoes. So full we <n>skipped</n> coffee and dessert this time, we will try and save room next visit. Overall an excellent dining experience all around. The ONLY suggestion I can offer is serrated knives for the steaks, chops etc..... We will certainly be back and will highly recommend you to friends and family looking for and exceptional evening out! Great job guys! Christopher,",John & Tony's,Chicago
