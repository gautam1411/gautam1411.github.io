4.1,"SO GOOD. I haven't been able to stop thinking about the <n>vegan</n> <p>cheesy nachos</p> since I ate here last weekend. My boyfriend even loved them and he is not a <n>vegan</n> or <n>vegetarian</n>. Also had the Banana pecan french toast and it was delicious as well. Will definitely be making it back to this place next time I visit Chicago!,",Pick Me Up Cafe,Chicago
3.8,"This place is just right in the heart of downtown. I tried their <p>buratta pizza</p> it was <n>licking</n>. Cocktail list also <n>exciting</n>. Perfect place for a date. <n>Cozy</n> place with great ambiance. Staff is very <n>friendly</n>.,",Bar Toma,All Reviews 11
4.3,"Stopped for lunch. First time at Chucks. Great Brunswick stew!, my <p>pulled pork</p> was also good. Friend had the special <p>stuffed peppers</p>. Service fast, friendly!  I will make a point of returning.,",Chuck's Southern Comforts Cafe,Chicago
3.7,"My mother and I went in your location in The Clubhouse Oak Brook today the 11th of May 2015 at around just after noon. We were seated at table 4/1 and served by Angelina.I ordered the <p>salmon crusted salad</p> and <n>asked</n> our waitress Angelina if I can please have the <p>salmon fish</p> and <n>grilled  chicken </n> she said it was no problem. My mother ordered a <p>chopped salad</p> excluding 3 ingredients but said she wanted everything else in it. My salad arrived looking very strange. The salmon was in these very <n>unappetizing</n> chucks that werent cut but looked like they were ripped apart. When I further looked I realized what the chef and Angelina have given me was the <n>discarded</n> scarps of the fish that were cut off the fillet, it was pure <n>fat</n> and scales that they disguised by the <n>grilling</n>. Absolutely disgusting. I was truly insulted and <n>appalled</n> that any restaurant, chef or wait staff would even serve that to a customer let alone a dog. When I nicely stated the fact to Angelina she offered me another salad that I <n>declined</n> the because of how disgusting the first salad was, and she messed up the order on my mothers, which we declined to tell her about. I then asked her for a <n>plate</n> and <n>cutlery</n> and Angelina took over 10 minutes to bring and when I did see her with just a plate she was attended to another table first while handing my plate and sticking it under her arm and handling god knows what else with the plate she was planning on giving me. I obviously told her I did not want that plate. A) On how long it took for her to give to me and B) how gross is it to hold and handle a customer’s plate in that way.My family and friends will never return to Clubhouse again your staff is extremely unwelcoming at the hostess post and all of your staff including cooks is unprofessional and insulting. I would never in a million years server discarded fish scraps to a customer!,",The Clubhouse,Chicago
3.7,"Excited about the menu. Played it safe with the <p>panko chicken</p>, but the sides were delicious. Saw fries pass by with another patron and I wanted to take them - definitely getting <p>fries</p> next time... Food came out quick and the patio served its purpose well. Prices were solid!The service was a little <n>abrupt</n> and <n>awkward</n> - for myself and other <n>customers</n> ordering as well. Not a huge deal, but a part of the <n>experience</n> that was worth noting.I plan to go back and would <n>recommend</n> this to anyone.,",BopNgrill,Chicago
3.9,"It's a really upbeat place with <n>courteous</n> staff and fresh food options and pretty pocket friendly for the quantity! So they give you a bowl with stick on which you are supposed to write your name. I think they have different <n>bowls</n> for lunch and dinner, the lunch one being smaller. You get variety of buffet options, mostly Asian to choose from. The only catch is they let you select only one protein, which you need to write in a piece of sheet stuck to the stick with your name. Will visit it again!,",Flat Top Grill,All Reviews¥Ë__9
3.7,"A really <n>pretentious</n> place. Server was inattentive and came off as rude. Ordered the <p>egg white omelette</p> which says had <p>turkey</p> and <p>avocado</p>; one piece of <n>tiny</n> <p>famous avocado</p> on a <n>giant</n> omelette filled with turkey made it <n>bland</n> and <n>tasteless</n>. Ordered a side of hash browns that was <n>overcooked</n> and <n>charred</n>. A <n>refreshing</n> restaurant name, but doesn't live up to it.,",Summer House Santa Monica,Chicago
3.5,"I love this place for <n>brunch</n> with my girlfriends. I enjoy the straight forward approach to food here. Flavors are great. Nothing is overly complicated. Excellent Bloody Marys. My favorite brunch dishes are the <p>lobster omelette</p>, the burger & shrimp with <p>fried green tomatoes</p>. Very good quality ingredients. Prices aren't super high, which makes this spot a great value in River North.,",Hubbard Inn,Chicago
4.3,"Delicious specialty <p>cheese pizzas</p> and cool vibe. We had an <n>excellent</n> meal here! Pizza was out and cooked pretty quickly and was excellent. We had the <p>twisted prosciutto</p> and <p>spicy arugula</p> as well as the <p>bread pudding</p> and <p>gelato dessert</p>. The waitress was friendly and helped us choose our <p>sausage pizza</p>. The atmosphere is a bit dark with quite a bit of room ambiance from people chatting and background music, which we were totally cool with.,",Union Pizzeria,Chicago
3.3,<n>Overpriced</n> for what you get. We ordered an appetizer platter. $26. They were out of onion rings so they <n>replaced</n> it with Mac and cheese. The past was significantly overcooked and fell apart on the fork. The sauce was somewhat flavorless. There were Bavarian style pretzels with <n>excessive</n> oregano and canned cheese for dipping. The spicy mustard was just odd-tasting. The buffalo wings were ok as were the corned beef sliders, (even though they weren't really sliders - just a quartered sandwich).  Add to that that a bottle of corona is $8 and I don't think we'll eat here again.,Kitty O'Shea's
3.2,"Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood attracts two types of people: hipsters and foodies. The combination of the two creates a dining scene that is less pretentious and more authentic than other restaurant hotspots in the city. When the folks at Parts & Labor invited me in to try their <n>offerings</n>, I couldn’t say no to eating out in one of my favorite <n>neighborhoods</n>. Do try their <p> Chicken salads </p> and <p> fruit salads </p>                                               ...Read full post on betterthanramen.net,",Parts and Labor,All Reviews 6
3.8,"<n>Amazing</n> burgers!!! My husband and I got the number one and number 5 burgers and shared them. Each ingredient in the burgers had an amazing flavor, but it all worked great together to make a really different and amazing taste. The number 5 was so different from any burger I had ever had...it was a lamb burger with <p>tzatziki  sauce</p>, <p>cheesy feta</p>, <p>roasted tomatoes</p>, and onions. It was hard to decide which one was my favorite!!! For dessert, we had a <p>caramel boozy shake</p>. It was so delicious! Service was great, super friendly! Definitely would come back here again!,",25 Degrees,Chicago
3.7,"This is a gem in the realm of a lot of good restaurants and bars in the Milwaukee West Loop area.  I like the style and look of this place. The food was very good and cocktails were spot on. Very vibrant scene.  Favorite food we had was <p>fresh spring peas</p> with <p>bacon</p> and <p>whipped Yukon gold potatoes</p> with a <p>black truffle sauce<p> / gravy.  WOW!,",Nellcôte,Chicago
2.9,"What a great addition to the <n>Buffalo</n> <n>Grove</n> area restaurant scene! I was really impressed that all of the food is made in- house. The <p>brats</p>, <p>tomato soup</p> stocks and even the <p>whipped</p> <p>cream</p> on desserts are created from scratch in house and it's evident in their food! I had a chance to sample a lot of options on their menu at their soft opening and can tell you I'll be going back. They specialize in what they call <n>Craft</n> <p>American Fare</p>,<p> Cheese Pizza </p> which I interpreted as really delicious <n>American dishes</n> that have been amped up to a new flavor level with great ingredients and preparation. Besides the food, the atmosphere is what I really enjoyed. There is a very spacious bar with nice <n>screens</n> for game day, there are multiple private rooms for small groups and there is a fantastic <n>patio</n> with a <n>fire pit</n> and outdoor <n>heaters</n> for cool nights! #sponsor.

3.6,"Very expensive.  The plates are pricey and very small.  The food is quite <n>tasty</n> but steer clear of the Angel <p>prawn skewers</p>.  I did enjoy the <p>cedar plank kurodai</p> (<p>bream</p>) and do order the <p>sizzling scallop onigi</p> -  they only serve 6 dishes of it per night.,",Momotaro,All Reviews 7
3.7,"This place is awesome! The Ensalada Azteca was one of the best salads I've had. The ingredient proportions were perfect! All of the food my friends and I ordered was bomb. Wish the fries in the <p>chili fries</p> were <n>thicker</n> but they were still good. I would go here everyday if I could. Legit.,",Native Foods Café,Chicago
3.6,"We had a big group for lunch and the service was warm and timely. I thoroughly enjoyed my soft, sweet and <n>savory</n> bean burger while the others in our group were equally enthused with their juicy perfectly cooked burgers. Even the turkey burger was moist!! Will be back for their extensive interesting drink menu.,",Rockit Burger Bar,Chicago
4.0,"Part of my food coma trip to Chicago.  1/2 block from the train station makes it an easy place to get dinner.  Interior decor was quite nice, the only thing that might have made it better was a bit more of a cozier feel, but that is personal preference, it was open and airy and when the place is full I am sure that is a good thing.  I was a bit early for dinner so only about 1/3 of tables were in use during my visit.  Wait staff was very very pleasant and my waitress gladly charged my phone for me while I ate.  They were very helpful in me deciding which of the dishes to enjoy.  The food was <n>fabulous</n>... had been about 10 years since I had an <n>Ethiopian</n> place to eat at, so it was extra good.  Service was prompt and friendly and the food tasted wonderful to me.  Everything was clean and nice. Added bonus it is literally across the street from the Green Mill jazz club... made for a perfect evening.,",Demera Ethiopian,All Reviews 13
3.9,"I tried this place out spontaneously once. Their <p>sweet potato fries</p> and <p>baked asparagus</p> are really good.
