We tend to walk-in and place our order so we can drink <p>margaritas</p> while we wait.

3.6,"I like <n>Kitsch'n on Roscoe</n>. Well, I have two hours to kill as I wait to meet my son, so I had <n>brunch</n> at Kitsch’n on Roscoe in Chicago, and now you get the benefit of an incredibly detailed review of the one item that I ate!!I ordered the “<p>Candied Bacon Brunch BLT</p>”.Wow, it was <n>delicious</n>, and I recommend that you try it if you eat here.Here is the menu description: <p>Scrambled egg</p>, candied <p>apple-wood smoked bacon</p>, <p> Chicken Sandwich</p> , <p>tomato soup</p> and <p>romaine</p> on <p>butter-griddled Brioche</p> with <p>honey mayo</p>, accompanied by Danish <p>hash browns</p>.Although the <p>multigrain bread</p> looks like ordinary white bread, it’s actually brioche baked into a <p>chicken sandwich</p> <n>loaf</n> shape. “<n>Butter grilled</n>” makes it soft, not <n>crispy</n>. Soft might also be a general feature of brioche, I’m not sure. I was satisfied with the soft <n>texture</n>, but normally I prefer crispy <p>toast</p> for a BLT. Keep that in mind if you, too, have a <n>crispy/soft</n> preference for BLT toast.The <p>scrambled egg</p> was delicious. Technically a “<n>folded egg</n>”, meaning I could see that it was <n>cooked</n> thinly and then folded over twice to give it a nice height and volume. I think that also makes a tidy <p>sandwich</p>, as chunks of <p>scrambled egg</p> don’t fall off the <p> veggie sandwich</p> when you pick it up.There was a generous amount of <p>bacon</p>, delicious, and the sweetness was subtle, probably appropriate for a sweet/savory <p>sandwich</p> like this. It seemed like maybe it was <n>brushed</n> with <p>brown sugar</p> while frying, it was not thickly coated with a candied crust or anything.The tomato and romaine were generous, fresh and crisp.The <p>honey mayo</p> was thin and subtly sweet, not heavy handed.Danish <p>hash browns</p> are awesome and delicious, I loved them. They are thick cubes of skin-on <p>potatoes</p>, prepared with purple <p>onions</p>, <p>red peppers</p> and lots of fresh <p>rosemary</p>. These are very strong flavored and well-seasoned, so again keep that in mind if you prefer traditional shredded <p>hashbrowns</p>, or breakfast <p>potatoes</p> that are milder.I’m here at 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon on a Wednesday, so the place is empty. But they can be quite busy during normal meal times.Kitsch’n on Roscoe is a “famous” restaurant that’s quite popular, it’s been featured on at least one television show, and has a great local reputation. The retro environment is wonderful. I suppose it’s an “intentionally kitschy” planned décor rather than “these genuine articles have been here for 50 years”, but it’s definitely comfy and charming.I had an awesomely friendly and competent server. I saw other reviews indicating that some servers here are not always so.When it comes to the price of restaurant food, I’ve totally lost perspective regarding what is “bargain”, “appropriate” or “overpriced”. Lately, to me, everything seems expensive!! The entrée I described was $9.50. That’s probably normal for this type of restaurant in Chicago’s Roscoe Village, Lakeview and Lincoln Park neighborhoods.,",Kitsch'n on Roscoe,Chicago

3.9,"Making reservations for this place would be great. It does get busy during lunch time, when we visited the restaurant.

Not sure it was $35.00 good, but it was a nice change from the <p>grilled fish</p> I usually order which is <p>salmon</p> or <p>tuna</p>. The <p>polenta</p> and <p>spinach bedding</p> the <p>Halibut</p> was served upon was very good as well. The polenta was a tad bit on the <n>firm</n> side, but that may be what they were going for since it had to support the <p>spinach corn sandwich</p> and <p>fish</p>, above it, in its presentation. For desert, I had the chocolate and <p>hazelnut mouse</p>. It was <n>topped</n> with a <n>crispy</n> layer of chocolate that really brought the dish together. Everything was wonderfully presented and the wait staff was attentive and accommodating This place would be great for a business lunch and <n>fancy</n> enough for date night or a celebratory family outing.

I opt for desserts that are fruit based and not very sweet.But there is one dessert that tempts me every time. It is like a siren call, almost completely irresistible. It is <p>frozen custard</p> and my favorite comes from Scooter’s in Chicago. Rich and creamy, this <p>custard fruit </p> is what ice cream WANTS to be when it grows up. At Scooter’s, custard is an art form. <p>Vanilla</p> and chocolate are always present. They have seasonal flavors (pumpkin in the fall is lovely!) and a ton of mix-ins available. Would you like a slice of <p>apple pie</p> mixed into your <p>custard pie</p>? <p>Chocolate chip cookie</p> dough? <p>Heath Bar</p>? <p>Bananas</p>? There are as many favorite combos as there are people.True to form my favorite thing on the menu here is a <p>strawberry concrete</p>: velvety <p>vanilla custard</p> with fresh <p>strawberries and cranberries</p> mixed in.

The lettuce wraps were <n>spicy</n> and very <n>messy</n>, just a warning to prepare yourself.

She apparently knew the couple at the next table well and got into a deep conversation with them about their daughter and her shared love of jumping horses with the couple.

Had the <p>spicy salami</p> and <p>ricotta bruschetta</p> and I was very impressed! <n>Light</n> and <n>delicious</n>. The <p>penne pasta</p> were delicious without being <n>heavy</n>. The <p>corn carbonara</p> did not have <p>cheese mushroom</p> and <p>baked peas</p> unlike all other <p>corn carbonaras</p> I've had, however, it was definitely delicious, not extremely <n>creamy</n> or <n>salty</n>, light and <n>fresh</n>. Everything we had was light, fresh, and over all delicious. It is the type of place where you can overeat without falling into a food coma. Service was attentive without bring <n>over-bearing</n>. Overall had a great time.,",Tre Soldi,Chicago
3.1,"I vowed to never go to this place since I walk by it every time I go to my brother's place and I see the constant s*** show outside. Then my girlfriend made me go here to see 3 cover bands (<p>Weezer</p>, <p>Red Hot Chili Peppers</p>, and <p>Sublime</p>). I should've held my ground...It's not that it's a terrible place. The staff are all friendly and fun to talk to, and they'll definitely tell you some of the more ridiculous stories. The problem is the patrons. It's generally a bro-fest, and the night we went we saw our share of ridiculousness. A girl that took her shoes off and was standing barefoot on the sticky floor. Another girl that was basically riding her boyfriend in the middle of everyone. Worst of all, some guy in a hooded sweatshirt that felt compelled to almost suffocate everyone around him with the noxious <n>clouds of farts</n> that he kept letting go.Never again, Cubby <n>Bear</n>.

3.8,"Lack of flexibility is annoying. The food and service here were above average on my visit, but I have to complain about the inflexibility of this restaurant on their fixed-price menu. My husband is allergic to <p>grilled fish</p> and shellfish and they flat-out refuse to make any changes to their set menu for people with food allergies (when we made the reservation we warned them about the issue). They claim that it is because some of the dishes on the menu, even those that aren't fish, are made with <p>backed cheese stocks</p> and sauces that may contain fish elements. Ok - first of all, why are some of the <p>chicken butter masala</p> on the set menu made with <n>fishy</n> stocks and yet none of the non-fish dishes on the regular menu are made with these same ingredients? These seems a little odd. Second, I don't mean to get uppity here but I have dined in some of the nicest restaurants in the world (Fat Duck, French Laundry and Alinea for example) and never once have we been told that the chef could not change the menu to accommodate allergies. So my question is - why does the chef at North Pond, which by the way is nowhere in the same league as the restaurants mentioned above, refuse to make accommodations for diners who WANT to spend money at his establishment? There are a lot of people with legitimate allergies to food, are they really unwilling to make ANY provision for these people?,",North Pond,Chicago

3.6,"WORST RESTAURANT IN PALOS. This is the <n>worst</n> restaurant I have ever been too, for food and service. I would not recommend this to my enemies. The only one good thing was sitting on the roof. When we first got there one of the members of our group ordered a glass of <p>White Zin</p>, it was the color of <p>apple cider vinegar</p> and so was the taste, it was sent back. My husband and I ordered a bottle of <p>red wine</p> and each of us requested a <p>glass of ice</p> to go with it. My husband got a glass of ice, I did not. We then ordered <p>black calamari</p> as an appetizer. It was brought to our table, but none of us had utensils or napkins, so it sat for five minutes until someone could get us utensils. I asked for a glass of ice again. Still don't have it after ten minutes. We then place our food order. Two diners ordered <p>chicken salad</p> and four of us ordered <p>meso soup</p>. Two diners received their salad and one diner received their soup. The other three of us assumed our soup we be brought out immediately after theirs. Finally our dinners come, we tell them three of us are still waiting for our soup. We told the we would take it to go. I then asked for my glass of ice. Two diners had the <p>smoked salmon</p>, which they said was okay and another diner had the <p>hot steak</p> which he said was good. One of the other diners had <p>Eggplant Parmesan</p> which she said was extremely <n>soggy</n>. Another diner had the <p>Rigatoni Caprese</p>, which had not taste and the <p>pasta noodle</p> was overcooked. I had the <p>Lemon Chicken</p>, which needed seasoning, I normally do not use salt and this really needed it. The plate was very white, the angel hair <p>pasta sauce</p> was overcooked. We finally got our check and I received my glass of ice. We never did receive our soups to take home. DO NOT GO HERE TO EAT!! The view was nice but that is the only thing that is worth it.

But I really liked the cocktail I ordered, the Mistress - a cool, <n>refreshing</n> <p>grapefruit flavored drink</p>. If you like grapefruit, you'll love this cocktail.

The Poutine came with bacon and peas and was super <n>cheesy</n> and delicious, not <n>weighed</n> down in gravy like Poutine can be. The <p>Pimento Dip</p> was good, but far and away, the real winner was the pretzel with goat cheese and red pepper dip. It tasted like a <p>jalapeno popper</p> without being fried, and the pretzel was crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside. I don't usually like goat cheese, but I loved this. And the presentation of all the dishes was creative. The only downside was the service. Apparently we got caught in a shift change and had quite the time trying to track someone down to pay our bill (like 20+ minutes of waiting for someone give our money to).

We don't usually splurge on high end fine dining but thought this would be a great opportunity to test the waters.  Upon stepping in the door the service is phenomenal.  You're led to your table and you can see there's a brigade of servers floating around making sure your water is never less than half full and meticulously placing new silverware with each course.  Once you're settled the service starts and it is definitely an experience. The tasting menu had about 10 courses overall.  Each one was presented in a unique way.  If you're looking for big portions you may be disappointed but to be honest I was satisfied by the end.  I could describe everything but I'm sure the menu changes fairly often so here were the highlights. - Fried oyster <n>coated</n> in granola was something I didn't even know was a thing.  Plus they served it in the shells but those shells were placed in this planter filled with sticks and pebbles.  -The salmon was the most delicate piece of fish I've ever had.

I could go on but I will say they put a lot of effort into the presentation of each course.  The ascetic of modern fused with nature definitely comes through.

3.8,"The other day, I stumbled upon an old Thrillist list that names Lockdown as having the best burger in Ukie Village. OK. It seems a little suspect; they have an array of burgers, all with a ton of craaaaazy, wild shit on them, but the standout one, The Lockdown Warden, is all leeks and cheese. I_¥Ë_¥Ë_m on board with that. I like leeks. Not to mention the <p>caramel cheese</p>. Although the restaurant_¥Ë_¥Ë_s website is full of a bunch of metal images and it_¥Ë_¥Ë_s <n>emblazoned</n> with the Iron Maiden logo, I feel like if a restaurant is brave enough to do something with leeks on a burger, I should go.A cascade of Freddie Mercuries greet me on three televisions as I walk in. That_¥Ë_¥Ë_s cool. Queen is something we can all agree on, correct? I like to think if I had started up a conversation about _¥Ë_¥Ë_A Day at the Races_¥Ë_¥Ë_ with those hard rock kids back in high school, our shoulders might have straightened a little and we might have had a decent conversation.And It_¥Ë_¥Ë_s a <n>beautiful</n> burger. Lovely to gaze upon. Green, yellow fireworks topped with a <p>pretzel bun</p> . I_¥Ë_¥Ë_m <n>excited</n>. I am the champion, my readers.But no. It_¥Ë_¥Ë_s terrible. The meat is <n>doughy</n>. Meat_¥Ë_¥Ë_s not a carbohydrate. Burger meat should not be doughy. I know, I know it_¥Ë_¥Ë_s grass-fed beef. Yes, farm to table. But it doesn_¥Ë_¥Ë_t taste right. And the <p>Merkts cheddar</p>, which has been <n>stuffed</n> inside the patty, squirts out the other end, onto the plate. Not in my mouth. I_¥Ë_¥Ë_m left with a lot of leeks about as <n>frazzled</n> as I am, and a <n>doughy</n> burger. I scoop up the <p>cheese sauce</p> with my finger in an effort to save myself, but apparently it_¥Ë_¥Ë_s children and men first because I_¥Ë_¥Ë_ve not been saved with this action and I_¥Ë_¥Ë_m <n>drowning</n> in regret.I want to like this burger. No one makes a burger with leeks. If there was a food draft, I_¥Ë_¥Ë_d like to think that my tribe picked leeks, like, third. The flavor can evolve so deliciously <n>drastically</n>: coyly sweet but <n>crisp</n> one way, <n>warm</n>, <n>mild</n> and <n>tender</n> another. But bite after bite, the leeks seem to further dull the flavor in the rest of the dish. Maybe they were <n>overfried</n>. I had such high hopes once.I assume it_¥Ë_¥Ë_s me. The burger was too hard rockin_¥Ë_¥Ë_ for little _¥Ë_¥Ë_The Shins made me cry once_¥Ë_¥Ë_ me. <n>Honestly</n>, though, it felt as though the Warden burger was a Loggins and Messina production.

3.5,"Great summer spot <n>equipped</n> with great patio seating. The food is <n>simple</n> and <n>unassuming</n>, but <n>excellent</n>. My recommendation is the <p>chicken sandwich</p>, <p>hush puppies</p> and a <p>nergoni slushy</p>. You'll probably have to wait to eat, but there's <n>ample</n> <n>seating</n> and entertainment to pass the time.,",Parson's Chicken & Fish,Chicago
3.7,"The quality of local options are great.  Had the fried rainbow trout and chips.  Outstanding batter that is light, flavorful yet doesn't just clump to the meat. Homemade <p>vinegared onions</p> for the <p>potato chips</p> was awesome.  Great local beer selection and atmosphere is antique but cool.,",Farmhouse,Chicago
4.2,"Gemato's Wood Pit ¥Ë_¥Ë_barbecue is Located in Naperville off Ogden. It came up on my Lunch search and thought to check it out with a friend who was visiting. I thought this will be a sit down restaurant but it is not. Th orders were <p>BBQ Baby Back Ribs_Half Slab</p> with Greek style potatoes, baked beans and bread, and <p>Beef Brisket Sandwich</p> with coleslaw on the side. The ribs were tender and melted in my mouth. The beef brisket was very tender as well. The thing I love d,most was the¥Ë_¥Ë_barbecue¥Ë_¥Ë_sauce it¥Ë_¥Ë_was not too sweet like many others . That was perfect for my¥Ë_¥Ë_palate. The <n>baked</n> beans was way too sweet for me , so couldn't finish it.Only crib I had was the food is served in Styrofoam takeaway container. My friend loved it and she said this was one the the best she had ever tasted in her life.Bottom line, the place is worth the hype,",Gemato's Wood Pit BBQ,Chicago

Same with the <p>Chichen Makhani</p>.�_Bottomline : A great place for those who miss / want to try the Indian cuisine.,",Indian Harvest,All Reviews�_9
3.8,"It was a bright Saturday hot afternoon, so I decided to have some <p>root beer</p> over here.And here was an unexpected great experience waiting for me in Emmett.As I went in,it was almost empty with few people in <n>dining</n> and bar area.I was received nicely at reception and seated comfortably.Patrick was my server on that day and he suggested to try <p>German Kolsch</p> as a <n>cooling</n> and <n>refreshing</n> <p>craft beer</p> for the hot afternoon.As this was my first experience in a brewery so I ordered a <p>beer paddler</p> which is a combination of 5 beers (<p>Munich Light</p> <p>German Lager</p>, <p>1 AM English Ale</p>, <p>Emmett's Pale Ale</p>, <p>Emmett's Red Ale</p>, Porters and Stouts). I personally loved <p>German Lager</p> which was crisp and refreshing.For food I ordered <p>Three Wings Sampler</p>(one of each buffalo, <p>Jamaican Jerk</p> and <p>red ale BBQ</p>) and <p>Emmett's Nachos</p> with <p>Emmett's Club Sandwich</p>.Food was really good, but the service made it better.I have read many average as well as bad reviews of this place, but as far as my experience it was excellent and I would soon be there again to try out more items on menu.                                instagram.com,",Emmett's Brewing Company,Chicago
3.8,"Very good <p>steak</p>, sides, apps, and <p>salads</p>.  Best steak <n>house</n> I've been to in <n>Chicago</n>.  Can be unpleasantly busy around <n>trade</n> shows which is unfortunate... one of the few times our company has to get together for nicer <n>longer</n> dinners.,",The Capital Grille,All Reviews 11
