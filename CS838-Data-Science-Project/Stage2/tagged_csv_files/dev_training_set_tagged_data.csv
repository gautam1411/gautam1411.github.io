4.3,"I have seen this restaurant many times while walking downtown Naperville. It looked <n>quiet</n>, <n>quaint</n>, and <n>pretty</n>. I was taking my adopted"," mom for her birthday lunch in Naperville, so I suggested this place. She agreed and off we went!They placed us by the window and it was perfect. The ambience by the window was so pretty as we looked outside and got ray of sunshine on us. It was nice. They gave us a dinner menu by mistake and while we were deciding, they switched our menu to a lunch menu. We could still get the dinner stuff if we wanted to. My mom already had her heart set on a <p>dinner pasta</p>. I started to flip and flop. I ended up getting a <p>meatball sandwich</p> from the lunch menu while at first I wanted a <p>chicken dish</p>.We also ordered <p>calamari</p> for <p>appetizer</p>. It was really really good. It looked pale with very <n>thin</n> <n>breading</n>. However, when you ate them... So good! They're <n>super tender</n>, <n>flavorful</n>, <n>humongous</n>! They gave you a lot of <n>gigantic</n> <n>tentacles</n>! Mom and I were kinda fighting for it tho there were plenty. They were so delicious!Her <p>spaghetti pasta</p> came in <p>red sauce</p> with shrimps and <p>cheesy scallops</p> and other seafood. The shrimps were <n>huge</n> as well and mom was just enjoying her lunch so much. It was a really <n>big</n> portion and she barely made a dent. She'd be eating that for <n>dinner</n>, <n>lunch</n>, and another dinner.My meatball sandwich was a good size too and they filled the bread with three meatballs. I ate one and half meatballs and was done. The meatballs have great taste but it was too <n>salty</n> for me. The bread also got too <n>soggy</n> to be able to be picked up.Service was great and <n>attentive</n>. A couple of complaints, they kept refilling my <p>ice tea</p> by pitcher, and it was just pure <p>tea</p> and no <p>ice</p>. By the third cup, I had no ice either in my glass. Then, it was just tea, not <p>iced tea</p>. The second one was we had <n>lunch</n> rather early and the whole place was open. They placed a guy to sit by us though there were so many other open spaces. The guy sat so close to us on that <n>tiny</n> nook. It was fun before for me and mom to be able to talk freely and now we had one guy just sitting by us. Lol. No offense, guy. However, a little privacy was preferred. However, overall it was very pleasant and good lunch. Mom enjoyed it and that was all that mattered.",La Sorella di Francesca

3.6,"Full disclosure, my wife and I came in using the $120 Groupon for the tasting menu on 8/9.  When I saw that I had to snap it up.  We don't usually splurge on high end fine dining but thought this would be a great opportunity to test the waters.  Upon stepping in the door the service is phenomenal.  You're led to your table and you can see there's a brigade of servers floating around making sure your water is never less than half full and meticulously placing new silverware with each course.  Once you're settled the service starts and it is definitely an experience. The tasting menu had about 10 courses overall.  Each one was presented in a unique way.  If you're looking for big portions you may be disappointed but to be honest I was satisfied by the end.  I could describe everything but I'm sure the menu changes fairly often so here were the highlights. - Fried oyster <n>coated</n> in granola was something I didn't even know was a thing.  Plus they served it in the shells but those shells were placed in this planter filled with sticks and pebbles.  -The salmon was the most delicate piece of fish I've ever had. I don't even enjoy fish and it was cooked just rare so that it was flaky and amazing.  - <p>Clam chowder</p> that was prepared at the table. The soup was extremely delicate and my wife commented that this was one of the first times she really saw me trying to get every bit of soup onto my spoon.  I could go on but I will say they put a lot of effort into the presentation of each course.  The ascetic of modern fused with nature definitely comes through. You could even tell that the bowls and other serving ware were chosen because it seemed like they were molded with a woodsy pattern.  I'd give acadia a 4.5.euroatheart.com,",Acadia,Chicago

This is our first time, so we decided to try the famous <p>fat rice</p>"," and along with two small <p>entrees-beef croquettes</p> and house-made <p>dumplings</p>. The <p>croquettes</p> was made of <p>mashed potatoes</p> and had a little bit <p>curried beef</p> mince in it, deep frying made it crunchy outside but still soft inside. As soon as I tasted the dumplings, I knew it was handmade. The skin was thicker and more chewy, we loved it with little bit <p>chili sauce</p>. Ok, the ",! It was very overwhelming in a good way! It is a mix of everything-BBQ <p>pork sausage</p> curry <p>chicken</p> <p>prawn</p> clam <p>olives</p> etc.The <p>rice</p> was hidden underneath cooked with <p>shredded duck</p> and <p>Chinese sausage</p> plus  sweet & sour <p>grapes</p>.

3.8,"Lack of flexibility is annoying. The food and service here were above average on my visit, but I have to complain about the inflexibility of this restaurant on their fixed-price menu. My husband is allergic to <p>grilled fish</p> and shellfish and they flat-out refuse to make any changes to their set menu for people with food allergies (when we made the reservation we warned them about the issue). They claim that it is because some of the dishes on the menu, even those that aren't fish, are made with <p>backed cheese stocks</p> and sauces that may contain fish elements. Ok - first of all, why are some of the <p>chicken butter masala</p> on the set menu made with <n>fishy</n> stocks and yet none of the non-fish dishes on the regular menu are made with these same ingredients? These seems a little odd. Second, I don't mean to get uppity here but I have dined in some of the nicest restaurants in the world (Fat Duck, French Laundry and Alinea for example) and never once have we been told that the chef could not change the menu to accommodate allergies. So my question is - why does the chef at North Pond, which by the way is nowhere in the same league as the restaurants mentioned above, refuse to make accommodations for diners who WANT to spend money at his establishment? There are a lot of people with legitimate allergies to food, are they really unwilling to make ANY provision for these people?,",North Pond,Chicago

Well, I have two hours to kill as I wait to meet my son, so I had <n>brunch</n> at Kitsch’n on Roscoe in Chicago, and now you get the benefit of an incredibly detailed review of the one item that I ate!!I ordered the “<p>Candied Bacon Brunch BLT</p>”.Wow, it was <n>delicious</n>, and I recommend that you try it if you eat here.Here is the menu description: <p>Scrambled egg</p>, candied <p>apple-wood smoked bacon</p>, <p> Chicken Sandwich</p> , <p>tomato soup</p> and <p>romaine</p> on <p>butter-griddled Brioche</p> with <p>honey mayo</p>, accompanied by Danish <p>hash browns</p>.Although the <p>multigrain bread</p> looks like ordinary white bread, it’s actually brioche baked into a <p>chicken sandwich</p> <n>loaf</n> shape. “<n>Butter grilled</n>” makes it soft, not <n>crispy</n>. Soft might also be a general feature of brioche, I’m not sure. I was satisfied with the soft <n>texture</n>, but normally I prefer crispy <p>toast</p> for a BLT. Keep that in mind if you, too, have a <n>crispy/soft</n> preference for BLT toast.The <p>scrambled egg</p> was delicious. Technically a “<n>folded egg</n>”, meaning I could see that it was <n>cooked</n> thinly and then folded over twice to give it a nice height and volume. I think that also makes a tidy <p>sandwich</p>, as chunks of <p>scrambled egg</p> don’t fall off the <p> veggie sandwich</p> when you pick it up.There was a generous amount of <p>backed cheese bacon</p>, delicious, and the sweetness was subtle, probably appropriate for a sweet/savory <p>sandwich</p> like this. It seemed like maybe it was <n>brushed</n> with <p>brown sugar</p> while frying, it was not thickly coated with a candied crust or anything.The tomato and romaine were generous, fresh and crisp.The <p>honey mayo</p> was thin and subtly sweet, not heavy handed.Danish <p>hash browns</p> are awesome and delicious, I loved them. They are thick cubes of skin-on <p>potatoes</p>, prepared with purple <p>red fried onions</p>, <p>red peppers</p> and lots of fresh <p>rosemary</p>. These are very strong flavored and well-seasoned, so again keep that in mind if you prefer traditional shredded <p>fried hashbrowns</p>, or breakfast <p>potatoes</p> that are milder.I’m here at 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon on a Wednesday, so the place is empty. But they can be quite busy during normal meal times.Kitsch’n on Roscoe is a “famous” restaurant that’s quite popular, it’s been featured on at least one television show, and has a great local reputation. The retro environment is wonderful. I suppose it’s an “intentionally kitschy” planned décor rather than “these genuine articles have been here for 50 years”, but it’s definitely comfy and charming.I had an awesomely friendly and competent server. I saw other reviews indicating that some servers here are not always so.When it comes to the price of restaurant food, I’ve totally lost perspective regarding what is “bargain”, “appropriate” or “overpriced”. Lately, to me, everything seems expensive!! The entrée I described was $9.50. That’s probably normal for this type of restaurant in Chicago’s Roscoe Village, Lakeview and Lincoln Park neighborhoods.,",Kitsch'n on Roscoe,Chicago

3.8,"This place does not have the typical sushi menu, so it took a bit of time to find some food items that spoke to me.  I tried the <p>chicken lettuce wraps</p>, <p>soft shell crab roll</p>, <p>unagi trio roll</p>, and <p>spicy tuna roll</p>.  The lettuce wraps were <n>spicy</n> and very <n>messy</n>, just a warning to prepare yourself.  The soft shell crab roll was good, actually lighter than the usual soft shell crab roll so it didn't taste as greasy.  The unagi roll was yummy, but I am a huge fan of eel and the sweet <p>eel sauce</p>.  The spicy <p>tuna roll</p> was a familiar roll, similar to every other sushi place.  But there is nothing wrong with that.  Our service was great, the waiters brought the food out as it was ready very promptly.  So far it was a wonderful experience, the only bad part was the owner/manager(not sure who she was, she alluded to owning the place in her conversation) spent half our meal with her butt in our face.  She apparently knew the couple at the next table well and got into a deep conversation with them about their daughter and her shared love of jumping horses with the couple. Yes she was close enough that I could have been included in the conversation as well.  I either could stare at my dinner partner or the kitchen, looking outside wasn't an option because she was standing right next to me, <n>facing</n> the couple, and have her conversation.

3.7,"A smattering <n>pricey</n> for the portion sizes – from the wine pours to entrées - but we would certainly try them again, especially since they’re in our neighborhood (…but only after they fix the air conditioning.) We started off with cocktails <p> blue lagoon</p>, including the <p>Armeni-tini</p> ($11) a light and <n>refreshing</n> <p>pomegranate tequila cocktail</p> and <p>vodka martini</p>, and the <p>Fried Chili Idli</p> ($10), a <p> honey sweet tart</p> and <n>mildly</n> <p>chile vodka concoction</p>, served up with a huge sprig of <p>cheesy quesedia</p>. Certainly <p>craft drinks</p> worthy of the price.We started with the <p>Mezza Sampler</p>, which was delivered mere seconds after ordering. The long, three-sectioned plate featured labneh – a “<p>farmer’s cheese dip</p>”- which tasted like <n>plain</n> <p>cream cheese</p> with a <p>fruity olive oil drizzle</p> and a light dusting of <p>paprika pizza</p>. There were two <n>ice cold coffee</n>, but <n>flavorful</n>, <p>yalanchi sarma</p> - <p>grape leaves</p> <n>stuffed raisins</n> with <p>raisin bran</p>, <p>almonds</p> and <p>chopped herbs</p>.

For $10.95, the offering was a decent way for two people to sample some of their traditional fare.The dining space itself is long and very (very) dark, with several small, semicircular cubby-holes that easily seat two, maybe three, with a third chair. On a recent Saturday night, the back of the room had been set up for a table of 20 when we arrive, but during our 90 minute meal, there were only about a dozen people in the restaurant. There were a few dining tables outside, and the bar can easily seat six to eight people. The bathrooms are down a steep flight of stairs, and were absolutely spotless. One thing we noticed half way through our dining was the temperature in the restaurant was rising rather quickly – despite being directly under an airduct, we could feel no air flowing. Some of the guests around us pointed out the room’s temperature to their waiters, and it sounded like the restaurant was having some problems with their air conditioning.  Feeling the heat, we opted for a glass of the <p>Armenian wine</p> ($9), a fresh and <n>fruity</n> pomegranate-based red, and a glass of one of their summer special <p>white wine</p>, a Pierre et Papa ($9) – sadly, the pours in the small <p>goblets of fire nuggets</p> were rather miserly for the money.Much like the appetizers, our entrees arrived very quickly after ordering – the <p>shish kabobs</p> ($20.95) featured perfectly seared cubes of herbaceous lamb, cooked to exactly medium rare and sporting a nice, evenly charred crust. The flavors were spot-on, but the bed of white rice underneath was utterly flavorless. Our second entree, the Armenian Combo –was billed as “a generous serving of <p>spicy sarma</p>, <p>baked boereg</p>, <p>hara kufta</p> and eggplant”, but was woefully lacking in generosity at $17.95. The three piece sarma (<p>stuffed grape leaves</p>) were stuffed with <p>minced meat</p> and spices, unfortunately they were covered in a rather tasteless, <n>cheese-like</n> sauce we couldn’t identify. The kufta, a lone, golf ball-sized meatball, was nicely flavored with spices and came swimming in a lemony cream sauce. The boereg was the only real stand out – a perfectly crispy filo-wrapped portion of spinach and cheese. The roasted eggplant was nothing more than a non-pureed version of their baba ghannouj. By now, it was rather stifling inside the restaurant due to the lack of airflow, so instead of ordering desserts and coffee, we opted for our check – just over $104.00, before tip.,",Sayat-Nova,All Reviews 20

While we introduced ourselves, and laughed off the proximity of our seating, our server extraordinaire recommended an awesome 12-year-old <p>red wine</p> (by the glass, no less!) to my wife and, for me, the first of many (many!) <p>Bulleit Bourbon Old Fashioned cocktails</p>.�_�_We started with some <n>appetizers</n> for the table; the Imported <p>Italian Burrata</p> ($15) featured a massive ball of <n>milky</n>, <n>salty</n> <p>mozzarella cheese</p> and a large portion of olive-oil soaked <p>tommy-toe tomatoes</p> with thickly <n>sliced</n>, <n>perfectly-toasted</n> bread _�_ certainly the highlight of the evening. The <p>Dipping Flight</p> ($13) came with a <n>dollop</n> of <n>flavorless</n> <p>hummus</p>, <n>runny</n> <p>babaganuj</p> and a tiny portion of <n>cold</n> <p>plain pitas</p>. The <n>Crispy</n> <p>Risotto Balls</p> ($12) were neither <n>crispy</n> or <n>warm</n>, and the <p>goat cheese fondue</p> was set up like a brick of Velveeta.

The small ramekin of <n>brownish</n> <p>meat</p> for the Braised <p>Duck Tacos</p> ($13) was cold and tasted like <n>sweetly-sauced</n> <p>barbecued chicken</p>. The plate also featured the smallest white <p>corn tortillas</p> we_��ve ever seen _�_ barely the size of a <p>wheat beer</p> can coaster. The side dish of <p>Fingerling Potatoes</p> ($9) were certainly reheated in the microwave and had a funky <n>lemony</n> back taste. The wife_��s <p>Kale Salad</p> ($12) was nicely portioned and had a large serving of <p>shilly quinoa</p>, <p>crouton soup</p> and was perfectly dressed with a <n>flavorful</n> anchovy <n>dressing</n>.�_�_During the entire evening, our server was remarkably attentive and, as promised, kept the <p>bourbon</p> coming for the duration of the performance.

3.6,"Full disclosure, my wife and I came in using the $120 Groupon for the tasting menu on 8/9.  When I saw that I had to snap it up.  We don't usually splurge on high end fine dining but thought this would be a great opportunity to test the waters.  Upon stepping in the door the service is phenomenal.  You're led to your table and you can see there's a brigade of servers floating around making sure your water is never less than half full and meticulously placing new silverware with each course.  Once you're settled the service starts and it is definitely an experience. The tasting menu had about 10 courses overall.  Each one was presented in a unique way.  If you're looking for big portions you may be disappointed but to be honest I was satisfied by the end.  I could describe everything but I'm sure the menu changes fairly often so here were the highlights. - Fried oyster <n>coated</n> in granola was something I didn't even know was a thing.  Plus they served it in the shells but those shells were placed in this planter filled with sticks and pebbles.  -The salmon was the most delicate piece of fish I've ever had. I don't even enjoy fish and it was cooked just rare so that it was flaky and amazing.  - <p>Clam chowder</p> that was prepared at the table. The soup was extremely delicate and my wife commented that this was one of the first times she really saw me trying to get every bit of soup onto my spoon.  I could go on but I will say they put a lot of effort into the presentation of each course.  The ascetic of modern fused with nature definitely comes through.

4.2,"Salad bar - GreatStaff - Fun to interact with, personable, knowledgableFood - Fantastic. �_Obviously places like these need to be good, entree wise, to justify the price. �_Everything we had was seasoned perfectly. �_The <p>prime rib</p> was melting on our plate, the <p>pork loin</p> was encrusted with <p>parmesan</p>, the <p>sirloin</p> was cooked fantastically. �_The salad bar had <p>charcuterie</p>, <p>tabouli</p>, <p>smoked meats</p>. �_I'd go back in a heartbeat. �_Just had a good time all together.,",Chama Gaucha,Chicago

3.9,"Although it's super dark inside, it's worth the dine! All the food was in quite generous proportions. Their <p>foie gras</p> was <n>creamy</n>, their <p>steam mussels</n> fresh,their <p>blue oysters</p> (blue pool) fat and <n>sweet</n>, their <p>escargot savoury</p>, <p>stake tartare</p> delicious.

3.9,"The menu is very small, as is the restaurant itself. I think we counted 32 total seats! I know they didn't used to take reservations, but they have since changed that which is nice - especially now that I've seen how small the space is. We didn't try one thing that I didn't like. Menu standouts were: <p>garlic fries</p>, <p>octopus appetizer</p>, <p>halibut</p>, and <p> garlic bread</p>. They also had an <p>oyster appetizer</p> and <p> cheese pizza</p> that was really unique - 3 <p>oysters</p> each prepared a different way. The third was smoked with <p>applewood chips</p> and had a cover on it, so when you opened it up, the <n>smoke</n> billowed out. Delicious! Another plus is that it's a BYOB, with a $5 <n>corkage</n> fee for the whole. Not bad at all. Finally, the <n>bathroom</n> was so cool! It had a <n>door</n> leading into it, and the wall was lined with <n>old</n> concert promo <n>posters</n>.,",Ruxbin,Chicago
3.9,probably the worst restaurant in wheaton....you think you cant get away with calling your customers n**ger, huh? NOPE. <n>sexual harassment</n> is a big no-no too. this place is disgusting and horrible and their utterly <n>childish</n> manager actually negatively reviews other restaurants in town under the name , total monsters run this place avoid at all costs
4.3,"<n>Stopped</n> for lunch. First time at Chucks. Great <p>Brunswick stew</p>!, my <p>pulled pork</p> was also good. Friend had the special <p>stuffed peppers</p>. Service fast, friendly!  I will make a point of returning.,",Chuck's Southern Comforts Cafe,Chicago
4.2,"Great service and <n>great</n> food. Our server, Jeanette, was wonderful. We had seven people in our group and we wanted to <n>try</n> several dishes but couldn't narrow down our choices. She was attentive to what we wanted and suggested family style among other things. She checked in to make sure we were all doing fine. She put our order in two sets so we weren't overwhelmed with the salads, appetizers, pastas, and entrees we ordered. And at the end when we left we forgot our leftovers she ran outside to give it to us. The food was delicious - our favorite dishes were the <p>mushroom ravioli</p> and <p>mushroom risotto</p>. The <p>chocolate ravioli</p> was a well-balanced flavorful dish. The <p>risotto</p> was smoky and creamy but not mushy. The braised <p>lamb shank</p> was very tender and matched well with the <p>saffron orzo</p>. I was looking forward to the <p>butternut squash ravioli</p> but it was just a little too sweet for my <n>spicy palate</n>. Overall though it was great and I'd go back any day.,",Zia's Trattoria,Chicago
3.6,"Pizza, <p>garlic breadsticks</p>, <p>mozzarella sticks</p> and a 2 liter.Not only were the breadsticks <n>overcooked</n> to the point of being hard tack, but the pizza was <n>UNDERCOOKED</n>.  (And being chicago style- not good we could notice that).Mozzarella sticks were undercooked, <n>limp</n> and <n>soggy</n>. but they were clearly store bought anyway, so whatever.But the crowning achievement was that they gave us a 2 <n>litter</n> of <p>mountain  dew</p> that was 3 MONTHS OUT OF DATE!!  and considering they last for more than 6 from production, I wonder how fresh the actual ingredients they use in the kitchen.2/10 - delivery guy didn't even know if we PAID or NOT when he delivered.Either get your shit together and <n>pay</n> attention to what you're giving to your customers, or go work for .,",Aliano's Ristorante,Chicago
3.9,"Making reservations for this place would be great. It does get busy during lunch time, when we visited the restaurant. I had the <p>Pacific Halibut</p>, which I haven't had at any restaurant, previously. I thought I'd try something new and it was very good. Not sure it was $35.00 <n>good</n>, but it was a nice change from the <p>grilled fish</p> I usually order which is <p>salmon fish </p> or <p>tuna</p>. The <p>polenta</p> and <p>spinach bedding</p> the <p>Halibut</p> was served upon was very good as well. The polenta was a tad bit on the <n>firm</n> side, but that may be what they were going for since it had to support the <p>spinach corn sandwich</p> and <p>grilled fish</p>, above it, in its presentation. For desert, I had the <p>chocolate hazelnut mouse</p>. It was <n>topped</n> with a <n>crispy</n> layer of chocolate that really brought the dish together. Everything was wonderfully <n>presented</n> and the wait staff was attentive and <n>accommodating</n> This place would be great for a business lunch and <n>fancy</n> enough for date night or a celebratory family outing. I'll have to go back to try the many <n>steaks</n> on their menu.,",Kinzie Chophouse,Chicago
3.8,"<n>Fast</n> and <n>welcoming</n> service! Also the food is unique and tasty, from omelettes to pancakes. I would definitely recommend! If you even remotely like pancakes, I would strongly suggest any of the pancakes,",Bongo Room,Chicago
3.5,Terrible customer service!My wife and I bought a Groupon to try this place out. The Groupon was good Sunday through Thursday only. We went there on a Sunday evening and paid $4 to park. When we got out of the car and walked up to the door there was a printed off sign taped to the door that said No Groupon's This Weekend.," When we asked the hostess she said that the owner didn't want to allow the Groupon deal to be used, even though it was Sunday and according to the TOC we should've been able to use the deal.There are a lot of places to eat in Chicago, we will not be going back here.",Blue Agave
3.6,"I had heard a lot about this place, so I was able to make to stop by to filter our many beers at the nearby Revolution Brewing Taproom. The menu offers <p>chicken pieces</p>, <p>chicken wings</p>, or <p>veg cheese sandwiches</p>. I went with a <p>boneless breast sandwich</p>, <p>grilled sandwich </p> . The piece arrived with a delicate, crunchy honey based batter coating, and a side of extra <p>honey butter</p>. Spreading the butter on the chicken, I felt like I had just discovered a new world.The focus throughout the menu is on locally sourced food where possible. Drinks menu is Chicago-area beers, although there is <p>still Miller</p> or Tecate for the <n>stubborn</n>, even the <p>soda fountain</p> has locals like Green River, all featuring 100% <p>cane sugar</p> (except for Diet Coke cans). Has a big repetitional locally, but I can still bring out of town friends to this as a secret discovery.<p>Honey Butter Fried Chicken</p>"
3.9,"I tried this place out spontaneously once. Their <p>sweet potato fries</p> and <p>baked asparagus</p> are really good. I also ordered the <p>roasted veggie quesadilla</p> and the <p>black bean burger</p> which were decent. Would definitely go back to try their grown-up <p>grilled cheese</p>!,",Bluestone,Chicago
3.8,"I will start this review by stating that I am a sucker for patios and their outdoor seating is just delightful!  In the <n>winter</n> I will settle for their <n>luscious booths</n> and mood lighting too:)  My mom Karen Elizabeth Phillipp loves to go here with her girlfriends for lunch and we always hit it up for  dinners after her concerts or just cause:)  One of my favorite appetizers is the <p>jerk chicken fondue</p> and my mom's pick for entrees is always their <p>fish specials</p>:)  Patrick Phillipp was with us on a recent trip and noted that the <p>ribs</p> were pretty <n>solidity</n>, but not the best he's ever had.  I'm always coming back here with family or my bestie in the burbs Ashley Marie because it's great quality food with a great atmosphere.                                northandred.com,",Redstone American Grill,Chicago
