4.1,"We received a gift certificate from a car dealership to eat here. Call Gordon Ramsey. It was <n>horrible</n>. So <n>dirty</n>. We were seated directly under the soda machine. The ice was so loud,not to mention I could see under the soda machine and they had a dirty rag stuffed under it. The waitresses butter the toast  after bussing dirty tables,that's a cooks job. It's such a dirty dirty restaurant. It's Crammed full of tables and you can't move.It's just not a nice environment to eat in.,",EggShells,Chicago
