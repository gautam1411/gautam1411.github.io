4.2,"We stopped in at the Bar on Buena (BOB) on the 4th of July. It was one of the only restaurants open on the 4th in the Uptown area and came highly recommended from a friend we were with. The 4th was a <n>beautiful</n> day and the BOB had <n>seating</n> that has a perfect mix. The BOB was serving a strict brunch-only menu until 3 pm, which was fine because some of us wanted breakfast food, but when a friend asked if they could order their favorite menu item, a simple <p>grilled cheese</p> and <p> chocolate donuts</p>, the waitress flat out refused. This was the first of the dismal service we experienced while there. Our waitress was outright <n>rude</n> at times (possibly because she was working on a <n>holiday</n>?) and when someone in our party went to the bar to ask for a pen, she was <n>ignored</n> by several staffers who were <n>standing</n> around talking, for several minutes.Luckily, I often find it's the company that makes the experience, so we still had a good time and enjoyed the basic fare. Two of us ordered the Brunch <p>Torta with scrambled egg</p>, <p>baked beans</p>, and <p>cheese sandwich</p> (what could have easily been a <p>grilled cheese</p> if fried, just saying), which was ginormous and filling, if not bland (thank god for <p>siracha sauce</p>). The best thing about this meal was <n>honestly</n> the flavorful <p>jalapeno rice</p> and <p>baked beans</p>. My husband ordered the <p>Tres Leches French Toast</p>, which sounded <n>fancier</n> than they actually were. We also had several brunch <p>polish beers</p> and <p>korean wine</p> while there and the BOB seemed to be well-stocked.Overall, I'd give the BOB another chance to try out their dinner menu if in the neighborhood again, but would have little expectations for the service.                                windycity-wanderlust.blogspot.com,",The Bar on Buena,Chicago
