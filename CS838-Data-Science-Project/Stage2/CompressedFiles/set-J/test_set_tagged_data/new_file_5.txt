I loved their <p>fruit beer</p> and <p>scotch whiskey</p> selection. They have a small patio in the back yard it's a nice. Their speciality is <p>Fish & Chip</p>. Beer battered <p>fried cod</p> served with <p>fried peas</p> and <p>choco chip</p>. Totally in love with it. Good job guys. Keep it up,",Duke of Perth,All ReviewsÂ 5
