3.7,"My mother and I went in your location in The Clubhouse Oak Brook today the 11th of May 2015 at around just after noon. We were seated at table 4/1 and served by Angelina.I ordered the <p>salmon crusted salad</p> and <n>asked</n> our waitress Angelina if I can please have the <p>salmon fish</p> and <p>grilled  chicken </p> she said it was no problem. My mother ordered a <p>chopped salad</p> excluding 3 ingredients but said she wanted everything else in it. My salad <n>arrived</n> looking very strange. The <p>grilled salmon</p> was in these very <n>unappetizing</n> chucks that werent <n>cut</n> but looked like they were ripped apart. When I further looked I realized what the chef and Angelina have given me was the <n>discarded</n> scarps of the fish that were cut off the fillet, it was pure <n>fatty</n> and scales that they disguised by the <n>grilling</n>. Absolutely disgusting. I was truly <n>insulted</n> and <n>appalled</n> that any restaurant, chef or wait staff would even serve that to a customer let alone a dog. When I nicely stated the fact to Angelina she offered me another salad that I <n>declined</n> the because of how disgusting the first salad was, and she messed up the order on my mothers, which we <n>declined</n> to tell her about. I then asked her for a plate and cutlery and Angelina took over 10 minutes to <n>bring</n> and when I did see her with just a plate she was attended to another table first while handing my plate and sticking it under her arm and handling god knows what else with the plate she was planning on giving me. I obviously told her I did not want that plate. A) On how long it took for her to give to me and B) how gross is it to hold and handle a customerâ€™s plate in that way.My family and friends will never return to Clubhouse again your staff is extremely unwelcoming at the hostess post and all of your staff including cooks is unprofessional and insulting. I would never in a million years server discarded fish scraps to a customer!,",The Clubhouse,Chicago
