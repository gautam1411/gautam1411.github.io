3.8,"First off, I love the decor of this place. We sat upstairs tucked in a back corner and the energy was vibrant! I couldn't pick a cocktail from the extensive list, so I told my server I liked <p>cinnamon whiskey</p>, <p>tequila shots</p>, and <p>maple mezcal</p> as my drink-bases. They made me a drink that was <n>outstanding</n>. We had the <p>burrata appetizer</p> which was <n>highly</n> <n>recommended</n> from other reviewers, and it did not disappoint. The portions were very <n>generous</n> and we had plenty left over. We split two pastas: hen egg, sage, and <p>brown butter</p> and the crab, <p>sea urchin</p>, and <p>chili taglioni</p>. Both were <n>outstanding</n>. Would order both again in a heartbeat. Pricey but not <n>outrageous</n>!,",Balena,Chicago
