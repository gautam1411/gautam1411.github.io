3.8,"Went here for a office dinner. The <n>ambience</n> is nice and relaxed. Ordered the <p>Sapporo lager beer</p> which was <n>delicious</n> and with that had <p>baby ribs</p> and <p>fried calamari</p>. <p>Baby ribs</p> a must try for sure.... I ordered <p> scallops</p> and <p>shrimp</p> with <p>fried rice</p>... The shrimps were good but the scallops could have been a tad more crispers which would have then insanely delicious.,",Big Bowl,Chicago
