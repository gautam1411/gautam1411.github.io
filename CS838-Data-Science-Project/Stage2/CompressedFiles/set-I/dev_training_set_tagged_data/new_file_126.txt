3.9,"Unbelievably horrendous experience on Saturday 1/30/16.  We had a <n>reserved</n> for 4 adults at 6:15PM.  The <n>table</n> was not ready when we arrived early at 6:00 PM....it was not ready at 7:00PM...or 7:15 PM (an hour later than our reservation) after <n>numerous</n> complaints to the hostess and seating <n>staffing</n>.  They put us in the bar area and could care less....explaining that their <n>reservation</n> system was screwed up and they were not prepared for an evening <n>concerted</n> that was occurring at 8:00 PM at North <n>Central</n> <n>studying</n>.  Literally, dozens of people were in the same <n>boated</n> and the GM was hiding in the back...I asked for her and waited...only to hear the same <n>story</n> about reservation <n>overbooked</n>.  We ended up eating in the bar area that was jammed with <n>skilled</n>...the food sucked!  <p>Cajun blackened salmon</p> was raw in the <n>middle</n>....yes, <n>raw</n> and uncooked....the <p>chicken salads </p>had almost no <n>dressing</n>...the drinks and food way overpriced.  Save yourself some <n>time</n>, aggravation and <n>money</n>...spend it at another <n>restaurant</n> in Naperville that cares....like <n>Sullivans</n>, <n>Hugos</n> or many others in the immediate area.  I find it hard to even give this restaurant, staff and especially the GM one star:),",Catch 35,Chicago
