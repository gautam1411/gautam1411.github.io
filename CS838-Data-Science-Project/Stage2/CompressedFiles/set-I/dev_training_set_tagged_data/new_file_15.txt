3.1,"I have had lunch here a few times.  The <p>raw seafood</p> is <n>tasteless</n> and not well prepared.  The size of the portion for the price are sub par.  And the service.  Some of the worse in the area. The supply of drinks is slow.  The tuning of food is poorly planned and you are waiting an excessive amount if time.  Much better value for your money in the area.,",The Hampton Social,Chicago
