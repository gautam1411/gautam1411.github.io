3.9,"In town for a <n>Petty</n> Shop Boys Concert . Stopped in at 7:00pm on a Saturday nite. Only four people in the place. Service was fast, <n>friendly</n> and efficient. <p>Pad Thai</p> was a large portion and very tasty. Tom Yum was abundant with <p>straw mushrooms</p> and the <p>lime leaves</p> added to it's wonderful <n>fragrance</n>. Prices for dinner are VERY responsible.,",Siam Rice,All ReviewsÂ 6
