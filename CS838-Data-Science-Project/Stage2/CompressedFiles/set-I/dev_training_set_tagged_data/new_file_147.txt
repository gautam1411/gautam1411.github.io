4.4,"This place is awesome! It's right by my brother's place and we tend to get takeout from here whenever my parents are in town. Very well priced, and they put <p>queso chihuahua</p> on a bunch of their items, which is always welcomed. I'm a big fan of their <p>guacamole enchiladas</p>, and <p>the great gringas</p> (that doesn't mean what you...yeah, if you thought that it's on you really). The service is always great, and fast. We tend to walk-in and place our order so we can drink <p>margaritas</p> while we wait. They're quite <n>big</n>, and that's always a good thing.Â Definitely worth <n>checking</n> out if you're in the area by comparison to some of the other local offerings.,",Cafe El Tapatio,Chicago
