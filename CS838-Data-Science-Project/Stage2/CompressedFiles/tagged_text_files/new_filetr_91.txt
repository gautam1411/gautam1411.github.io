3.8,"This place does not have the typical sushi menu, so it took a bit of time to find some food items that spoke to me.  I tried the <p>chicken lettuce wraps</p>, <p>soft shell crab roll</p>, <p>unagi trio roll</p>, and <p>spicy tuna roll</p>.  The lettuce wraps were <n>spicy</n> and very <n>messy</n>, just a warning to prepare yourself.  The soft shell crab roll was good, actually lighter than the usual soft shell crab roll so it didn't taste as greasy.  The unagi roll was yummy, but I am a huge fan of eel and the sweet <p>eel sauce</p>.  The spicy <p>tuna roll</p> was a familiar roll, similar to every other sushi place.  But there is nothing wrong with that.  Our service was great, the waiters brought the food out as it was ready very promptly.  So far it was a wonderful experience, the only bad part was the owner/manager(not sure who she was, she alluded to owning the place in her conversation) spent half our meal with her butt in our face.  She apparently knew the couple at the next table well and got into a deep conversation with them about their daughter and her shared love of jumping horses with the couple. Yes she was close enough that I could have been included in the conversation as well.  I either could stare at my dinner partner or the kitchen, looking outside wasn't an option because she was standing right next to me, <n>facing</n> the couple, and have her conversation. It was only as we were getting our check that she decided to just sit down next to the couple, instead of <n>standing</n> next to me with her butt in my face.,",Mirai,Chicago
