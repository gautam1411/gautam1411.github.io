4.3,"Delicious specialty <p>cheese pizzas</p> and cool vibe. We had an <n>excellent</n> meal here! Pizza was out and cooked pretty quickly and was excellent. We had the <p>twisted prosciutto</p> and <p>spicy arugula</p> as well as the <p>bread pudding</p> and <p>gelato dessert</p>. The waitress was friendly and helped us choose our <p>sausage pizza</p>. The atmosphere is a bit dark with quite a bit of room ambiance from people chatting and background music, which we were totally cool with.,",Union Pizzeria,Chicago
