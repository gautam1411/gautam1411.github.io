4.0,Ever since I head Cereal <n>Encrusted</n> <p>French Toast</p>," I knew I had to come here and since I've been, I'm disappointed. They are just french toast with cereal on top.... that's it :(However, the other food we got was top notch! I got the <p>omelette with mushrooms</p> and they were the best mushrooms I've had in a long while---and I eat a LOT of '<p>mushroom masala</p>! My date got the special which was like the inside of <p>baked enchiladas</p> with an egg on top. It was great and I <n>enjoyed</n> <n>eating</n> the leftovers the next day!Â Overall, I really enjoyed Flo, but would not come again for their french toast with <p>kellogs cornflakes</p> on top.",Flo
