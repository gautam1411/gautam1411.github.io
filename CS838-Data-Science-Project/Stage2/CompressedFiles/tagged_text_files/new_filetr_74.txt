3.8,"Yum yum yum yum... Just went here for brunch and since its a week day, there was no crowd. We love brunch and were not disappointed by the selection, quality or speed of the food. For your entrees, you can choose as your side: <p>mini pancakes</p>, <p>mini waffles</p> or toast. Pancake and waffle selection for minis include the specialty pancakes/waffles like <p>strawberry rhubarb</p>, <p>banana dulce de leche</p> and <p>cinnamon roll</p>...so good and minis are actually quite big. We also had a <p>veggie skillet</p>, meaty omelette, and <p>sweet potato hash</p> with <p>scrambled eggs</p>. Coffee is a bit expensive but its Intelligentsia for us coffee snobs. Our waitress was quick, courteous and gave us space to play cards after we ate :).                                                chiorganicgirls.com,",Stax Cafe,Chicago
