The potatoes weren't <n>cooked</n> through in the <p>yellow curry</p> and the penang <n>tasted</n> like it was made with with <p>peanut butter</p>. I don't even thnk they used <p>coconut cream</p> as could not taste. Don't go to this place if you been to Thailand and know what a Thai curry should taste like.,",Dao Thai,Chicago
