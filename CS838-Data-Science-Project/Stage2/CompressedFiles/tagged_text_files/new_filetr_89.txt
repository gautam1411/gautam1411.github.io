3.8,"The other day, I stumbled upon an old Thrillist list that names Lockdown as having the best burger in Ukie Village. OK. It seems a little suspect; they have an array of burgers, all with a ton of craaaaazy, wild shit on them, but the standout one, The Lockdown Warden, is all leeks and cheese. I_´è_´è_m on board with that. I like leeks. Not to mention the <p>caramel cheese</p>. Although the restaurant_´è_´è_s website is full of a bunch of metal images and it_´è_´è_s <n>emblazoned</n> with the Iron Maiden logo, I feel like if a restaurant is brave enough to do something with leeks on a burger, I should go.A cascade of Freddie Mercuries greet me on three televisions as I walk in. That_´è_´è_s cool. Queen is something we can all agree on, correct? I like to think if I had started up a conversation about _´è_´è_A Day at the Races_´è_´è_ with those hard rock kids back in high school, our shoulders might have straightened a little and we might have had a decent conversation.And It_´è_´è_s a <n>beautiful</n> burger. Lovely to gaze upon. Green, yellow fireworks topped with a <p>pretzel bun</p> . I_´è_´è_m <n>excited</n>. I am the champion, my readers.But no. It_´è_´è_s terrible. The meat is <n>doughy</n>. Meat_´è_´è_s not a carbohydrate. Burger meat should not be doughy. I know, I know it_´è_´è_s grass-fed beef. Yes, farm to table. But it doesn_´è_´è_t taste right. And the <p>Merkts cheddar</p>, which has been <n>stuffed</n> inside the patty, squirts out the other end, onto the plate. Not in my mouth. I_´è_´è_m left with a lot of leeks about as <n>frazzled</n> as I am, and a <n>doughy</n> burger. I scoop up the <p>cheese sauce</p> with my finger in an effort to save myself, but apparently it_´è_´è_s children and men first because I_´è_´è_ve not been saved with this action and I_´è_´è_m <n>drowning</n> in regret.I want to like this burger. No one makes a burger with leeks. If there was a food draft, I_´è_´è_d like to think that my tribe picked leeks, like, third. The flavor can evolve so deliciously <n>drastically</n>: coyly sweet but crisp one way, warm, mild and tender another. But bite after bite, the leeks seem to further dull the flavor in the rest of the dish. Maybe they were <n>overfried</n>. I had such high hopes once.I assume it_´è_´è_s me. The burger was too hard rockin_´è_´è_ for little _´è_´è_The Shins made me cry once_´è_´è_ me. <n>Honestly</n>, though, it felt as though the Warden burger was a Loggins and Messina production. Burgers or sandwiches piled high with a pound of crap, even if it_´è_´è_s one ingredient of crap, was never my scene. I want to taste complexity in the meat. I want to taste the balance of cheese against that burger.thesandwichdamsel.com,",Lockdown Bar & Grill,Chicago
