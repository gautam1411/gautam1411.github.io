3.9,"A Place to Enjoy <n>Retro</n> Quality Food and Ambiance. The food here is amazing. I could have made a meal of the <n>piping hot</n> <n>fresh</n> <p>baked bread</p> and <p>baked malbec</p> and called it good. Luckily, my carb avoiding ways won out and I was able to enjoy the other fines choices. Portions are generous, feel free to split an entree. The <p>caesar salad</p>, which list as serving two people, actually could serve four. Even the <p>grilled chicken breast</p>, which could be mundane, had nice <n>flavor</n> and <n>moistness</n>. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.The ambiance is <n>noisy</n>, but fun. This is not the place to take someone to break up with them, or work through your personal issues unless you plan on raising your voice. We took my 90 year old grandmother and she thought it was too dark to clearly see the menu. However, once the food was delivered she had fewer complaints. One more tip: if you drive your car, spring for the valet as the neighborhood parking can be tricky and you don't want a ticket, if you can avoid it.,",Club Lucky,Chicago
