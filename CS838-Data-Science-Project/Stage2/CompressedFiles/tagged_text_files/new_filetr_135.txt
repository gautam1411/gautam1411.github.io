4,Here on a Saturday afternoon. Had the pretzels and cheese and <p>portobella strip fries</p>  which were good but very <n>greasy</n>. I had the best," sloppy joe as voted by WGN.  I have to admit it was darn tasty! I'd order it again. Flavorful with a good amount of acid and a touch of sweet. I chose the risotto as my side and it was good if a little over cooked.Hubby had the Grouper sandwich. Which I thought was VERY fishy tasting. No to my liking and he said he wouldn't order that again.Our friend Deb had the Reuben. It was a good, messy item with the right balance of meat and sauerkraut. Loved the pub fries.We've all been here for brunch before. Lots of choices and hearty. Not great but satisfying.  They have a. Decent selection of bottled and can beer with several games on the multiple TVs. A good casual place to meet.A solid 3.5 for for deb and I but Hubby thinks 2.5 so hence the 3 today.",Elgin Public House
