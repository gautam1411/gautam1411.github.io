3.9,"Making reservations for this place would be great. It does get busy during lunch time, when we visited the restaurant. I had the <p>Pacific Halibut</p>, which I haven't had at any restaurant, previously. I thought I'd try something new and it was very good. Not sure it was $35.00 <n>good</n>, but it was a nice change from the <p>grilled fish</p> I usually order which is <p>salmon fish </p> or <p>tuna</p>. The <p>polenta</p> and <p>spinach bedding</p> the <p>Halibut</p> was served upon was very good as well. The polenta was a tad bit on the <n>firm</n> side, but that may be what they were going for since it had to support the <p>spinach corn sandwich</p> and <p>grilled fish</p>, above it, in its presentation. For desert, I had the <p>chocolate hazelnut mouse</p>. It was <n>topped</n> with a <n>crispy</n> layer of chocolate that really brought the dish together. Everything was wonderfully <n>presented</n> and the wait staff was attentive and <n>accommodating</n> This place would be great for a business lunch and <n>fancy</n> enough for date night or a celebratory family outing. I'll have to go back to try the many <n>steaks</n> on their menu.,",Kinzie Chophouse,Chicago
