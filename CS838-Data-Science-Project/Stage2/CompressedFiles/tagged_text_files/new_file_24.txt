3.7,"Do not recommend coming here for dinner. It was my significant other and I. We ordered: 1 <p>draught beer</p> ($11), an order of <p>spring rolls</p> $10 (2 per order), <p>chicken curry</p>($18) and a large", beef pho ($19). The noodles in my curry chicken were <n>over-cooked</n> <n>swollen</n>/<n>soggy</n>. The , of pho came in a bowl that was the size I normally eat cereal out of. With that aside the flavor was only ok and the service was great. Again I don't recommend coming here for dinner unless you plan on paying $75 for 2 people for average food. If I wasn't so turned off by that experience I might try their lunch since that's what everyone else raves about.
