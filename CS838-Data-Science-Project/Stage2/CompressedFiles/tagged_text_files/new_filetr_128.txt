3.6,"I'm <n>staying</n> in the area for work. Some coworkers and I decided to try this place. It looked <n>beautiful</n>. Unfortunately it smelled like fish, which I really <n>dislike</n>. But we <n>stayed</n>. I <n>ordered</n> <p>Radiatori del Mezzadro</p>, but I <n>switched</n> it to <p>fettuccini</p> because I like to <n>twirl</n> my pasta! It was delicious. Then I had some <p>tasty tiramisu</p>. It was <n>beautiful</n> and delicious as well. (Had a bite of the <p>chocolate cake</p> too and even that was great!)Even the bread was good!The only down fall was the smell.The service was pretty good as well, even though I didn't get my water <n>refilled</n>. (But I was able to <n>snag</n> an unused one from a coworker)And it wasn't as <n>pricey</n> as it says. A <n>big</n> bowl of pasta and a dessert was $30. Idk how they estimate $150 for two people!t,",Carlucci Rosemont,All Reviewsï¿½_16
