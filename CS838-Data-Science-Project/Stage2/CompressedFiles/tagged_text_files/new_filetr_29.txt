3.7,"We went to Bijan's Bistro for an impromptu lunch over the weekend. We were greeted and seated outside by a very friendly little man with an accent. Our waiter greeted us right away and took our drink orders. He was fine, no complaints about the service.We <n>perused</n> the menu and <n>decided</n> to start with <p>Spinach and Artichoke dip</p>. The <p>cheesy salsa dip</p> itself was <n>delicious</n>, but the <p>chocolate cracker</p> that the serve it with, left a lot to be desired. The cracker would break no matter how you tried to get dip on it. And as soon as it hit your mouth it dissolved. <n>Tasty</n> dip, but needs a vehicle change.My lunch date ordered the <p>Shrimp BLT Sandwich</p> with <p>homemade chips</p>. It was very <n>underwhelming</n>. There were MAYBE 2 shrimp on the sandwich and one <p>slice of bacon</p>. It was very <n>plain</n> and really, not worth it.I ordered the <p>Grilled Beef Tenderloin Sandwich</p> with homemade chips. I must say that this sandwich was <n>wonderful</n>. The steak was cooked <n>perfectly</n> (medium) and the whole sandwich was very <n>flavorful</n> and <n>loaded</n> with meat. Well worth the money they charge for it. The homemade chips, for both sandwiches, were <n>slightly</n> over- AND <n>undercooked</n>. But <n>tasted</n> fine.Â Will <n>probably</n> head back there, but not in the near future.,",Bijan's Bistro,Chicago
