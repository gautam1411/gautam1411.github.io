3.9,"This is what a breakfast place should be. Everything I've eaten here so far has been great. The omelets, skillets, bennies, pancakes have all been amazing. Waitstaff was <n>helpful</n> and the food came out of the kitchen very <n>quickly</n> (within 5-10 minutes of ordering). Would definitely recommend for anyone in the Schaumberg and surrounding areas to give it a try.,",Egg'lectic Cafe,Chicago
