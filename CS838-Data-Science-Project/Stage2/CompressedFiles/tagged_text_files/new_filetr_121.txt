3.8,"Came in for lunch and was seated right away. The waiter Jeffery was very nice and helpful. Got the <p>fettuccini Alfredo with shrimp</p>.  The <p>white hot sauce</p> was kinda <n>soupy</n>. The <p>creamy pasta</p> was well <n>cooked</n> and held some of the sauce. To be honest my mother in law makes better.  Cool warehouse feel to the place. Lunch ran me $24 .,",Connie's Pizza,Chicago
