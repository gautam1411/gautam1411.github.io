3.3,"We enjoyed a quick lunch here. Had a window table with a great city view. Great servers, too. I had the <p>buffalo chicken wrap</p>, which was seemingly missing the buffalo because it wasn't spicy at all and it had too much of the blue cheese. My daughter had the <p>shrimp tacos</p> and they were a hit. Husband had a chicken sandwich, which was huge, and enjoyed it. This was a great stop for a break from shopping. We <n>enjoyed</n> the museum"," too, it was a lot of fun!",Harry Caray's Seventh Inning Stretch
