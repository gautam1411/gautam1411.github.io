4.4,The manager of this restaurant is extremely rude. I've eaten here countless times and have personally experienced his rude and unprofessional behavior. The last time took the cake. After being seated for my cousin's graduation we were rudely rushed along to order our food since it was a late reservation. We asked to speak with the manager to express our concerns for the waitress's poor attitude and he absolutely made matters far worse. After light debate he stated that he was refusing service, and asked us to leave. Clearly we were upset but on the way the way out we were farewelled by the very same waitress giving us the middle finger . I will never be returning. In which the manager expressed that he did not care anyway.,Hamada of Japan
