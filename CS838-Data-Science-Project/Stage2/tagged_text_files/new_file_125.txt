4.1,This is our favorite chicago style pizza. We order <p>deep dish with pepperoni</p> and <p>light garlic</p>! My husband loved the <n>burnt</n>, <p>cheese edges</p>. It is so <n>filling</n> and <n>tastes</n> so good. We keep going back again and again. My husband even had his bachelor party here!,Pequod's Pizza
