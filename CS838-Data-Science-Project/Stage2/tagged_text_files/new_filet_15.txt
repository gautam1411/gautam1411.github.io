3.9,"In Chicago, it was hard to find authentic Thai food. Sticky rice was a good option for Thai food though. The place was a little bit far from the city downtown. The service was good. <p>Stuffed calamari</p>: <p>deep fried calamari</p> was stuffed with chicken and glass noodle. <n>Crunchy</n> shell with tasty stuffing and sweet and chill sauce, very nice. Recommend! The <p>green papaya salad</p> was just ok.The <p>tom yum soup</p> was sweet and spicy and sour, perfect to have before other main dish. The <p>red curry duck</p> was average, cooked with pineapple, tomato, lychee. Hopeful they could more duck meat in it.Another popular dish was shrimps cooked with eggs. We all loved this one~ eggy and fragrant sauce was seasoned perfectly, and good to have with rice! Recommend! The dessert we tried was coconut hot cakes with corn and green onion. They came very hot, so be careful when u eat them. It tasted both <n>savory</n> and sweet, very interesting. The texture was more like rice cake, but softer, very nice~,",Sticky Rice,Chicago
