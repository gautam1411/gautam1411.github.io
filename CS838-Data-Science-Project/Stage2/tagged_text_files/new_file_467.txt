3.9,"Unbelievably horrendous experience on Saturday 1/30/16.  We had a reservation for 4 adults at 6:15PM.  The table was not ready when we arrived early at 6:00 PM....it was not ready at 7:00PM...or 7:15 PM (an hour later than our reservation) after numerous complaints to the hostess and seating staff.  They put us in the bar area and could care less....explaining that their reservation system was screwed up and they were not prepared for an evening concert that was occurring at 8:00 PM at North Central College.  Literally, dozens of people were in the same boat and the GM was hiding in the back...I asked for her and waited...only to hear the same story about reservation overbooking.  We ended up eating in the bar area that was jammed with people...the food sucked!  <p>Cajun blackened salmon</p> was raw in the middle....yes, <n>raw</n> and uncooked....the salads had almost no <n>dressing</n>...the drinks and food way overpriced.  Save yourself some time, aggravation and money...spend it at another restaurant in Naperville that cares....like <n>Sullivans</n>, <n>Hugos</n> or many others in the immediate area.  I find it hard to even give this restaurant, staff and especially the GM one star:),",Catch 35,Chicago
