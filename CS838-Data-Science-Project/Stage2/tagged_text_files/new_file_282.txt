2.9,"I'm pretty conflicted right now about this review. The food was really very good. I ordered the wings as an appetizer and the chicken sandwich as an entree. The wings were slightly spicy and very <n>meaty</n> which filled my stomach with joy and chicken. The sandwich itself was good but paled in comparison taste wise to the <n>wings</n>. The service was pretty bad, in terms of water refills it was fine, but when it came to anything more complicated the man came of snooty and uncaring.,",Reverie,Chicago
