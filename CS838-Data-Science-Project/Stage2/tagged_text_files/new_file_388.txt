3.5,"Had the <p>Logan Sandwich</p> and it was good, but pretty average as far as <p>sandwiches</p> go. The <p>kale </p>, <p>beet</p> and <p>sunflower salad</p> was a nice addition. While the food is nothing spectacular, the restaurant ambiance is really cool. There's even a <n>photo booth</n>! Cash only, so be careful. Nice patio as well.,",Reno,Chicago
