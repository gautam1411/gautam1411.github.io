4.0,"No <p>bacon candy</p>!  My <p>craft cocktail</p> was disappointing - <p>white negroni</p>.  And my wife complained that her cocktail was too strong.  Beer choices are ok.  <p>Brisket</p> was not lean.  However, the KC ribs were the best and the <p>Mac n cheese</p> was good.  Avoid the <p>beans</p>.  Great atmosphere and good enough food unless they run out.,",Honky Tonk Barbeque,Chicago
