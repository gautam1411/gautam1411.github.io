4.1,"Not a winner 2nd time around. We stumbled upon the Wheeling location after a family visit. Excellent service, food and presentation. Decided to try again after another family visit. Really looking forward to it. Disappointed. Husband's steak tough and undercooked. . Steamed asparagus tough, <n>shriveled</n> and <n>barely steamed</n>. My filet great but not cooked to order. <p>Garlic mashed potatoes</p> good but <n>lukewarm</n>. But when we expressed our disappoint, the waiter and staff handled it well and adjusted the bill. Not sure we will try again tho.,",Pete Miller's Steakhouse,Chicago
