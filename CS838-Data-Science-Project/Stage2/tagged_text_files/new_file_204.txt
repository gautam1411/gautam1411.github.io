4.1,"Delicious blend of polish and Italian cuisine. <p>Pizza</p> is always good, <p>perogi</p> is on point, and definitely try the <p>pork wings</p>. Bartenders and front house staff are the best. The back bar and patio workers seem to always have an attitude. I usually try to sit in the main dining area. Been coming here for years, one of the better south loop spots for beer and pizza. Great place for Bulls bears and Blackhawks games.                                                 chicagofoodgame.com,",Flo & Santos,Chicago
