3.4,Fabulous for our 25th Anniversary. Looked at dozens of restaurants for a special evening and chose Cite'. Was kind of nervous because I wanted something - couldn't have been more pleased!! When I made the reservation I told the host it was our anniversary and they <n>obviously</n> took note. As soon as we entered we were greeted with happy anniversary Mr and Mrs Andersen,". Our menus , moreover, had <n>anniversary</n> greetings, we were treated to a glass of <p>sparkling champagne</p>, and, generally, treated like <n>royalty</n>. The food was <n>fabulous</n>, the view was unmatched, the service - excellent. We will definitely come back to Cite' the next time we come to Chicago. To the staff the served us that night - 4/20 - THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! IT WAS A MARVELOUS EVENING!",Cit√©
