3.9,"Great business dinner!. Went for a business function, and had a great experience. Ate the fillet and it was delicious. Tender,and cooked just as requested. Loved the chocolate cake for dessert too. Their <p>creme brulees</p> are huge! Nobody left hungry! If I lived in Northbrook, I'd have to come back to try other things on their menu.,",Prairie Grass Cafe,Chicago
