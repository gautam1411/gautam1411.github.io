3.9,"<p>Craft beer</p> excellence paired with delicious food. This place is expanding rapidly with the addition of brewery tanks, coffee bar, and retail store. The atmosphere is reminiscent of a European beer hall. Awesome selection of Two Brothers beers all on tap. I found the dinner menu to be very creative; much better than I expected. I opted for three small plates which was plenty of food: <p>Kebabs</p> (<p>zucchini</p>, mushroom, red onion, <p>bell pepper</p> over <p>basil walnut rice</p>); Grouper (<p>blackened snowy grouper</p>, sweet bacon hash, sage beurre Blane); and Bison (<p>meatballs</p>, north wind cherry BBQ sauce, and <p>zucchini slaw</p>). I would return if my travels bring me back to Aurora.,",Two Brothers Roundhouse,Chicago
