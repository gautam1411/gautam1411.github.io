3.7,"I love Union, but not for the sushi. I love it for the <p>barbeque</p>. This is definitely a <n>trendy</n> spot. Union has a plethora of delicious options and happy hour specials that CANNOT be beat ($1 oysters, $2 beef skewers, and $4 shrimp tempura rolls). The way they dress their oysters is really delicious. Other dishes I've tried include: truffled tuna - good but overbearingly truffly",", prosciutto <p>wrapped</p> <n>scallop</n> - how could you go wrong here?, bbq califlower - omg this is my favorite thing on the menu, and many delicious and creative cocktails. Another thing that seems to be popular is subbing <p>black rice</p> into your sushi. Looking forward to going back.",Union Sushi + Barbeque Bar
