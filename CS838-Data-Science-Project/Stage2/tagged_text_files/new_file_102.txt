4.2,"This is one <n>happening</n> spot in Burr Ridge! ´è__Once the stores are closed, I'm pretty sure all the cars are there only for this restaurant. ´è__Love their variety of wine, food is okay, but I have never had anything that I ever been so impressed with that I would want to get it again. ´è__It's a great place to see and be seen in the burbs and get a few glasses, but service could be better overall. ´è__Sometimes it seems very <n>chaotic</n> with how <n>busy</n> it is, which I get, but think it could be better.                                                northandred.com,",Cooper's Hawk Winery & Restaurant,Chicago
