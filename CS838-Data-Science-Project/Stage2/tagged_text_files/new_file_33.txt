4.0,"This place is awesome! They're doing something different with each dish and they're doing it in a new, fun, delicious way. Atmosphere is unique and you can tell it's a chef centered restaurant. Every item on the menu was appealing and the <p>pimento Benedict</p> I ordered was <n>rich</n> and <n>flavorful</n>. Will be back for the <p>pork hash</p>.,",Bite Cafe,Chicago
