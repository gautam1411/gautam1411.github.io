3.8,"Went here for a office dinner. The ambience is nice and relaxed. Ordered the <p>Sapporo lager beer</p> which was delicious and with that had <p>baby ribs<p/> and <p>fried calamari</p>. Baby ribs a must try for sure.... I ordered <p> scallops</p> and <p>shrimp</p> with <p>fried rice</p>... The shrimps were good but the scallops could have been a tad more crispers which would have then insanely delicious.,",Big Bowl,Chicago
