4.0,"Great <n>Dogs</n> so close to Wrigley.... The smell from outside was of <p>Greek Spices</p> so I thought . My nose told me to check it out and was I glad I did . Great dogs at this little dive . Small bar where things are not over priced and a cast of characters that comes and goes . Don't expect 4 star service but do stop for some great eats and <n>budget</n> prices .,",Clark Street Dog,Chicago
