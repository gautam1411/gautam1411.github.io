3.9,"Must try for any indian foodie out there. The place is perfect for a small get together with friends and family. The overall ambience of the place is welcoming and comfortable with soft music in the background. The staff is patient and the service is good.Talking about the menu, <p>dal makhani</p> is a must try. We also ordered a <p>non veg platter</p> in which the fish and <p>lamb</p> pieces were surprisingly good. For breads, we ordered <p>butter and garlic naan</p> along with <p>curries</p> including <p>mutton roghan josh</p> and <p>chicken makhni</p>, which were all equally tasty. The dessert menu was short, with limited options. We ordered <p>kheer</p> and <p>pista kulfi</p>. The kheer was great, not too sweet, just the perfect amoumt. The <p>kulfi</p> was just okay.The bar didn't have much options to choose from. Also, the wait time can be killer of yoi don't reserve in advance,",Kama Indian Bistro,Chicago
