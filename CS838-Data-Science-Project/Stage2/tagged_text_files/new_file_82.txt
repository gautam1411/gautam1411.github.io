3.7,"Roka Akor is my standby when I can't decide if I want sushi or a great steak. The perfect place to take people you don't know very well dietarily because they can go with traditional <n>Japanese</n> dinner, or get a steak with all the trappings. Beautiful and chic ambiance, perfect for a date or business dinner. The service is warm but not <n>overwhelming</n>; you'll be well taken care of but never bombarded with helicopter waitstaff. A great, fast gourmet Japanese lunch black-laquer bento box style--one of my favorites in the city!
