3.7,"Came here for dinner and had an amazing time. We were a pretty big party and they seated us even though half our party wasn't there yet. Love the modern take on an Italian restaurant which creates a modern feel but still has touched that obviously show this is an Italian restaurant. Very fun upbeat atmosphere and not at all pretentious. The various options of unique <p>bruschettas</p> was amazing! Had the spicy salami and ricotta bruschetta and I was very impressed! <n>Light</n> and delicious. The pasta were delicious without being <n>heavy</n>. The carbonara did not have mushroom and peas unlike all other carbonaras I've had, however, it was definitely delicious, not extremely creamy or salty, light and fresh. Everything we had was light, fresh, and over all delicious. It is the type of place where you can overeat without falling into a food coma. Service was attentive without bring over bearing. Overall had a great time.,",Tre Soldi,Chicago
