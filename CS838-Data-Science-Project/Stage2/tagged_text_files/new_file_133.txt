4.0,"The first time we tried to get in here it was late and all of the tables were full. We resolved to come back the next day around what we thought would be an in between lunch/dinner time. Once again all of the tables were full but we were glad to wait about 30 minutes for a table to clear. Once we were seated a whirlwind experience began. We picked the #1 ChaDol-Gui. We noticed the Â menu stated it was a portion for 2 so we only ordered it plus a Mul Mandu appetizer. Normally we would order 2 items but I payed attention to the menu and other reviews advising not to order too much. It's a good thing because we had more than enough food for two. Every single thing we ate was good and I do not think we left anything behind. I also paid attention to the negative comments regarding the service and was ready for an abrasive server. Even on the night we were turned away we were politely told that they could not serve us. Even the 2 guys in front of us were told they could not get any take out food. The service was good, fast and efficient. If anyone was going to possibly get bad service, we might have been good candidates because I am Korean and my wife is Caucasian. I don't have a single complaint about our experience and would be ready to go back today.,",Cho Sun Ok,Chicago
