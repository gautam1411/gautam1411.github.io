4.2,"Nice old school <n>Italian restaurant</n>. Great veal options. Home made <p>gnocchi</p> and other <p>pastas</p> with just basic <p>sauces</p>. Excellent <p>pizza bread</p> comes with <p>crusty Italian bread</p> with every order. Large <p>wine</p> list. Outdoor patio has nice ambiance just off Irving Park road. Service was off a bit on the patio but it was a week night. If your looking for old school Italian from 50 yrs ago, this is your place.,",Sabatino's Restaurant and Lounge,Chicago
