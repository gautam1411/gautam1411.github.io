3.6,"Excellent small plates for sharing. I particularly enjoyed the <p>grilled squid</p>, <p>skirt steak</p> w/ <p>kimchi</p> and <p>trumpet mushrooms</p>. The chicken wings and twice-fried were also great, esp. with the accompanying sauces. We ordered a <p>ramen</p> to share among four people - the broth was rich and full of flavour. Overall, Yusho was a really positive eating experience. However, the cocktails were disappointing. I opted for The Classic"," with Japanese whisky, soda, and lemon. It came out as a watery whisky, with little flavour, a huge disappointment at $15. The second round wasn't much better though there was one cocktail with an egg white that everyone at the table loved, myself included!                                                krismlars.com",Yusho
