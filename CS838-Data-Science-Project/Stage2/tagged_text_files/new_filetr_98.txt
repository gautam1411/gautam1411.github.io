3.8,"In my wife's quest to eat the best ice cream in the city <p>Black Dog</p> was the next on the list.  Last night was our third attempt to visit this place as they were closed for the season a while ago and a storm had affected their gelato making abilities last week.  Well worth the wait though.I believe Black Dog is cash only so plan accordingly.  Once you're inside you'll see they have about a dozen or so flavors but each one is really unique.  Ginger, goat cheese, sweet corn, <p>peach tea</p>, cinnamon, <p>fig blossom</p> and chocolate chip, just to name a few off the top of my head.  I went with the unexpectedly <n>satisfying</n> sweet corn mixed with a classic cookies n creme.  Probably a weird flavor mix but who cares it was great <p>creamy gelato</p>.  You could taste the corn really clearly and if you've ever had a corn cookie from <p>Momofuku Milk Bar</p> in New York you'll know what I'm talking ant and how it makes a really perfect addition to a dessert. That's not it though.  They had a cooler with pre <n>packed</n> pints of day old ice cream. There was a deal 3 for $10!! My wife upon hearing this, looked at me in disbelief as if to say, Are you kidding me!!?!?!?!?"," Needless to say, we now have 3 pints of ice cream in the freezer at home.                                  euroatheart.com",Black Dog Gelato
