3.5,"I love this place for <n>brunch</n> with my girlfriends. I enjoy the straight forward approach to food here. Flavors are great. Nothing is overly complicated. Excellent Bloody Marys. My favorite brunch dishes are the <p>lobster omelette</p>, the burger & shrimp with <p>fried green tomatoes</p>. Very good quality ingredients. Prices aren't super high, which makes this spot a great value in River North.,",Hubbard Inn,Chicago
