3.9,"I liked my <p>French toast</p> and <p>assam tea</p> but - feel like no one has mentioned this is more like an expanded <p>cold coffee</p> <n>shop</n> under <n>condominiums</n>, in a relatively random location. Think coffee shop with <n>breakfast</n> items. (No <n>booths</n> like you think of for breakfast place.) Not a bad thing, just not probably what you imagine. Also not a <p>gelato</p> place. (Came for gelato - a previous review that said they have gelato??). Positives: friendly, clean, fast, reasonable prices, no line, a bathroom, excellent cup of <p>Assam tea</p>, <p>brioche</p> to make me fall into <p>sweet sugar</p> coma!,",Little Branch Cafe,Chicago
