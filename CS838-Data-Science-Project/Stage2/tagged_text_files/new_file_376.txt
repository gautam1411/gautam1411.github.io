3.8,"It was a bright Saturday hot afternoon, so I decided to have some <p>beer</p> over here.And here was an unexpected great experience waiting for me in <n>Emmett</n>.As I went in,it was almost empty with few people in <n>dining</n> and <n>bar area</n>.I was received nicely at reception and seated comfortably.Patrick was my server on that day and he suggested to try <p>German Kolsch</p> as a <n>cooler</n> and <n>refreshing</n> <p>beer</p> for the hot afternoon.As this was my first experience in a brewery so I ordered a <p>beer paddler</p> which is a combination of <n>5 beers</n> (<p>Munich Light</p> <p>German Lager</p>, <p>1 AM English Ale</p>, <p>Emmett's Pale Ale</p>, <p>Emmett's Red Ale</p>, <p>Porters</p> and <p>Stouts</p>). I personally loved <p>German Lager</p> which was crisp and refreshing.For food I ordered <p>Three Wings Sampler</p>(one of each <n>buffalo</n>, <p>Jamaican Jerk</p> and <p>red ale BBQ</p>) and <p>Emmett's Nachos</p> with <p>Emmett's Club Sandwich</p>.Food was really good, but the service made it better.I have read many average as well as bad reviews of this place, but as far as my experience it was excellent and I would soon be there again to try out more items on menu.                                instagram.com,",Emmett's Brewing Company,Chicago
