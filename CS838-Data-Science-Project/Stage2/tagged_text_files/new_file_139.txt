4.3,"This is a fun nostalgic place for breakfast in Hyde Park.  It is a cafeteria style restaurant but you need to know what you are going to order upfront.  It is very reasonably priced with a great selection.  It was an experience just going through the line.  These folks are in the business of feeding people in large numbers.  I had steak and <p>eggs</p>.  It is a very culturally diverse cafeteria and always is very busy... that's a sign you always want to see.   This is a place you just have to try for the experience.  I enjoyed it but it's cash only.,",Valois Cafeteria,Chicago
