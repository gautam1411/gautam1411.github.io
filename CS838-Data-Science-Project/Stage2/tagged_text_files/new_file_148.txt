3.5,"Great summer spot equipped with great patio seating. The food is simple and unassuming, but excellent. My recommendation is the <p>chicken sandwich</p>, <p>hush puppies</p> and a <p>nergoni slushy</p>. You'll probably have to wait to eat, but there's ample seating and entertainment to pass the time.,",Parson's Chicken & Fish,Chicago
