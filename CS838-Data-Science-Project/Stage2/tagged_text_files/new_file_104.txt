4.1,"my 3rd time eating at Ada street. Exceptional food, attention to detail, unique space, great music. The hidden restaurant unfolds as you walk into it and opens up into a <n>big</n> room with a great outdoor space. Happening bar, excellent service and an open kitchen.",Ada Street,All ReviewsÂ 5
