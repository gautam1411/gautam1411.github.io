4.2,"Gemato's Wood Pit ��barbecue is Located in Naperville off Ogden. It came up on my Lunch search and thought to check it out with a friend who was visiting. I thought this will be a sit down restaurant but it is not. Th orders were <p>BBQ Baby Back Ribs�Half Slab</p> with Greek style potatoes, baked beans and bread, and Beef Brisket Sandwich with coleslaw on the side. The ribs were tender and melted in my mouth. The beef brisket was very tender as well. The thing I love d,most was the��barbecue��sauce it��was not too sweet like many others . That was perfect for my��palate. The <n>baked</n> beans was way too sweet for me , so couldn't finish it.Only crib I had was the food is served in Styrofoam takeaway container. My friend loved it and she said this was one the the best she had ever tasted in her life.Bottom line, the place is worth the hype,",Gemato's Wood Pit BBQ,Chicago
