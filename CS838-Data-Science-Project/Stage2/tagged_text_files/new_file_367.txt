3.1,"Worst place ever. Our whole group left... 20 people because they wouldn't let one person back in, saying she was too intoxicated. Wow. Argued very long with the manager John Paul"," and he didn't seem to care. Unbelievable.  Should of gone to Red Head Piano Bar. This place is unbelievable,  they didn't seem to care about this person's valuables and tab of over $100 being inside,  all they cared about was getting their $10 cover charge from the line and not letting her back in. Don't go here!",Howl at the Moon
