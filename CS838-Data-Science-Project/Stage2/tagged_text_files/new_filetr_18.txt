3.6,"Simply the best Combo in the world. Perfect in every way, the gold standard in <p>Italian Beef</p>. Gravy is just right on the Italian spices, beef has correct bite to it, sausage is from Chicago (they're all good In Chi town), <p>chico giardiniera</p> is is <n>perfected</n> hot and the bread is strong enough to stand up to a double dunk.
