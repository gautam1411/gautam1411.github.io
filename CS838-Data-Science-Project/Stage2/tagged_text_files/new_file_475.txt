3.5,"Great <p>sushi</p> place in the burbs. Has an amazing outdoor patio but it only seats small parties. The indoor area is great too. The sushi is good and for people who don't like sushi there are great entree options. Has a pretty good wine list and cocktail selection. This is a regular hangout for me and I definitely recommend it.,",RA Sushi Bar Restaurant,Chicago
