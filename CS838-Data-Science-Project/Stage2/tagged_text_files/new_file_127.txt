3.7,"We went to Bijan's Bistro for an impromptu lunch over the weekend. We were greeted and seated outside by a very friendly little man with an accent. Our waiter greeted us right away and took our drink orders. He was fine, no complaints about the service.We perused the menu and decided to start with <p>Spinach and Artichoke dip</p>. The <p>dip</p> itself was delicious, but the <p>cracker</p> that the serve it with, left a lot to be desired. The cracker would break no matter how you tried to get dip on it. And as soon as it hit your mouth it dissolved. Tasty dip, but needs a vehicle change.My lunch date ordered the Shrimp BLT Sandwich with homemade chips. It was very underwhelming. There were MAYBE 2 shrimp on the sandwich and one slice of bacon. It was very plain and really, not worth it.I ordered the Grilled Beef Tenderloin Sandwich with <n>homemade</n> chips. I must say that this sandwich was wonderful. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium) and the whole sandwich was very flavorful and loaded with meat. Well worth the money they charge for it. The homemade chips, for both sandwiches, were slightly over- AND undercooked. But tasted fine.Â Will probably head back there, but not in the near future.,",Bijan's Bistro,Chicago
