3.5,"Had the <p>Logan Sandwich</p> and it was good, but pretty average as far as <p>tuna sandwiches</p> go. The beet and <p>sunflower salad</p> was a nice addition. While the food is nothing <n>spectacular</n>, the restaurant ambiance is really cool. There's even a photo booth! Cash only, so be careful. Nice patio as well.,",Reno,Chicago
