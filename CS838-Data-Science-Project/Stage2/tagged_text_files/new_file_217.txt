3.8,"Hands down my favorite casual breakfast/brunch spot in Lincoln Park. The food is always delicious and the service is too. Seriously, everything on the menu has been amazing and I've been coming here for a few years. My favorite is the Southwest omelette, but their rotating specials are great as well.,",Nookies Too,Chicago
