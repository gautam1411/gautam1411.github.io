3.8,"I've always walked by the beautiful outside patio but who knew the interior would prove to be just as wonderful? Wooden communal tables in a line stand atop and <n>glazed</n> brick floor and lead to a back wall full of <n>wines</n>. The menu is very cafe-esque as they have sandwiches and <n>French</n> fare along with a delectable case full of French <p>pastries</p>.-French <p>Onion Soup</p>: it's a bit <n>sweeter</n> than what I like but well made—filled to the brim with <p>onions</p> and delicious <p>soaked bread</p>.-<p>Tuna Melt</p> (<p>fresh beans</p>, <p>olives</p>, <p>tomato</p>, <p>gruyere cheese</p> on <p>sourdough bread</p>): oh my. Delicious! The tuna has such an intense flavor under the <n>salty</n> <p>gruyere</p>. It's like no tuna I've ever tasted—divine. The bread also has a lovely bite to it.  The side salad has is <n>drizzled</n> in a nice <p>balsamic vinaigrette</p> with a hint of added spice.FINAL VERDICT: the food and atmosphere of the place are <n>impeccable</n>. Beware though if you don't enjoy communal seating.",Pierrot Gourmet - The Peninsula,Chicago
