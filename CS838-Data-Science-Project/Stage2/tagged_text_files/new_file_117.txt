3.9,"My evening here was a fabulous blur, thanks to three <p>margaritas</p> on the rocks, no salt (because, I mean, liver damage is one thing, but I draw the line at high blood pressure). THE FOOD: foodie versions of <n>Mexican</n> cuisine. Stuff like tostidas de tinga: crispy small <p>tortillas</p> mounded with shredded Maple Creek Farms pork and <p>chorizo</p> in a roasted <p>tomato chipotle sauce</p>; topped with Mexican crema and avocado. SERVICE: The staff is impressively accommodating, gracious, and attentive. FAVORITE: Pescado al carbon: fresh fillet of seasonal fish, charcoal grilled and served with salsa fresca (fresh tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and serrano chiles), white rice. YOU SHOULD TRY the pastel tres leches: a light, <p>orange-flavored cake</p>, soaked in three milks, frosted with <p>freshly</n> <n>whipped cream</n> and served with <p>raspberry sauce</p>.                                                makeitlikeaman.com,",Salpic√≥n,Chicago
