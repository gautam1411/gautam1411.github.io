3.6,"I found myself out in Schaumburg for a family birthday party at the ale house.  I'm not sure what I was really expecting as I've never heard of this place before. It seemed like the menu was pretty standard. You'll find burgers and fried apps like mozzarella sticks, with some steaks and <p>seafood</p> things as well.  This is the kind of place where you pretty much know what's on the menu before you walk in the door.  Not that it's necessarily a bad thing. If that's what you want, you know you won't be disappointed. There wasn't anything that I was too impressed with but everyone I was with seemed to enjoy.  I will say this though, the inferno burger was Damn spicy.  And I can take the heat.  For being in Schaumburg this place is just fine hence the 3 stars. The service and quality of the food was good. There was just nothing that stood out to me.  I'd say its a good spot for a family gathering as they are very accommodating for large groups.euroatheart.com,",Stonewood Ale House,Chicago
