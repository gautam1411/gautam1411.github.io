4.0,"I haven't eaten inside the restaurant, but we've gotten takeout from here many times. Could not possibly give it anything other than 5 stars. The crust is paper thin, so when they say no more than 3 toppings, they MEAN it. We love the '<p>nduja pizza</p>, which was a spicy, <p>spreadable sausage</p> that <n>blew</n> our minds. For takeout, they gave us a cup of <p>fried basil</p> to put on at home, and the combination of the <p>sweet basil</p>, <p>spicy sausage</p>, and <p>tangy sauce</p> was unreal. The <p>pepperoni pizza</p> and <p>grilled ricotta</p> is also <n>fabulous</n>. I cannot wait to take my family to this restaurant and to try more!,",Coalfire,Chicago
