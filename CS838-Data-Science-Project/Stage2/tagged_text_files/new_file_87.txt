3.7,"My husband and I LOVE Indian food! We always have to try out the best Indian food in the area whenever we are on vacation. I've been to Chicago a million times with my family and we always have to stop by Devon Ave. before going back. This time however, my husband and I just decided to walk around and just go into any restaurant that sounds good. We walked by Tiffin and decided to try it out.The ambiance of this restaurant is amazing! Its so beautifully designed and the layout of the place is wonderful! The place is super clean with no <n>overwhelming</n> smells! We walked in during lunch time on a Sunday and it wasn't too busy. My husband opted for the lunch buffet since it had <p>Lamb curry</p> and that's all he really wanted. I wanted the <p>Chicken Tikka Masala</p> and it wasn't included in the <n>cheesy</n> so I ordered it off the menu. The staff was super great and attentive. Our waiter went to the back while I was waiting to give my order and the owner came over and asked if I needed anything. I asked him about the buffet and then asked when the waiter was coming back. He told me to just give him the order and he'll get it in and asked if I wanted a <p>masala coke</p> or <p>green tea</p>. He even brought my plate and <p>soft cold drinks</p>! That definitely made an impression on my husband and I. The waiter himself also brought us <p>garlic butter naan</p> numerous times and refilled our drinks quite often. I loved the service here. The food itself was SO GOOD!!!! My husband had 3 plates and my Chicken tikka masala was super Delicious! They also had some wonderful music playing. My husband recognized some of the songs and loved it. We will definitely recommend this place to all our family and friends and make sure they come here whenever they are in Chitown!  We can't wait to come back! Thanks Tiffin!!!,",Tiffin,Chicago
