3.7,"The quality of local options are great.  Had the fried rainbow trout and chips.  Outstanding batter that is light, flavorful yet doesn't just clump to the meat. Homemade <p>vinegar</p> for the <p>chips</p> was awesome.  Great local beer selection and atmosphere is antique but cool.,",Farmhouse,Chicago
