4.0,"My wife really likes this joint, and I have something against it. I don't know what it is though. Every time I eat here I find myself saying that is fantastic. I love the <p>smoked pastrami Sammy</p>. The <p>pie</p> is great. Same with the taco's and burgers. Screw my feeling, they have great food.,",The Lucky Monk,Chicago
