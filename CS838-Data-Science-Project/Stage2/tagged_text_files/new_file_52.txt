3.2,"With only three tables, this place offers a simple menu of primarily <n>authentic</n> <p>Mexican tacos</p> without the fanfare. Nestled within a tiny shopping strip, this family owned restaurant does mostly carry out business. Service is pleasant, and while the ambience is family and conversation friendly, there isn't enough space for more than 6-8 diners. The prices are reasonable and the food is fresh.,",Totopos,Chicago
