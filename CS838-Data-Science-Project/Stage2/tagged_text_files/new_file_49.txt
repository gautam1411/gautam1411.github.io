3.8,"I absolutely ADORE this place. Everything is delishes and the waitstaff is super friendly. I work about two blocks away and came in for breakfast one morning about 8 months ago and I return at least 5 times every month. The <p>egg sandwhich</p> is <n>fantastic</n> and is what hooked me. I even take an earlier train once in a while so I can sit and relax in the cafe instead of taking it to go. I have even ordered their boxed picnic options and sat at millunium park enjoying them with friends while listening to various concerts. Just a great place!,",Toni,Chicago
