3.3,"Major fail. I was looking to sit on a terrace to enjoy a <p>cocktail</p> before dinner and called the hotel to check if the outside area of the restaurant was open (as the weather had not been that great) I was initially told yes but then put on hold for the guy to check but then reassured that yes it was open. Imagine my frustration when I turned up and it was closed! and no apology from the guy cleaning the bar area just 'well it rained an hour ago'ï¿½_Im sure this is a lovely location but really disappointed at such poor customer service. nofixedabodeforsue.com,",Shanghai Terrace,Chicago
