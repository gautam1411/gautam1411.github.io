3.6,"I'll be honest, this was a place I've been wanting to try for a long time & wanted to love...but that just did not happen. I'll reveal why as you read on...or IF you read on.I ordered the <p>black bean burger</p> with a <p>side salad</p> & it was surprisingly good. If you're a normal <p>veggie burger</p> eater than you know its hard to find one that doesn't completely fall into a million pieces after the first bite...that did not happen & was lovely. It's strange but the amount of <p>avocado</p> I was given was way too much. My boyfriend ordered the <p>southwest omelet</p> & <n>enjoyed</n> it aside from the <p>chorizo</p> tasting more like <p>hamburger</p> meat than chorizo.My first complaint came from the rather rushed service that still left my <p>coffee</p> empty for quite some time. And while we're talking about coffee...my biggest complaint is that once I drank my mug to the bottom I noticed an old coffee ring that had been left inside from prior use. It easily rubbed off with my finger which tells me the <n>glass</n> was not washed. It left me feeling quite ill.Also, it's cash only. But they do offer an ATM inside.,",Jam 'n Honey,Chicago
