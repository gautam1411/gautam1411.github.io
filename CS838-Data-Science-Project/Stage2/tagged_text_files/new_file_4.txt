3.1,"Bar Takito is a sister restaurant to Takito Kitchen in Wicker Park. Located right beside the Morgan el stop in the West Loop, Bar Takito has a large sidewalk patio seating area, and a spacious interior with two bars. The space is <n>bright</n> and <n>colorful</n> and has lots of seating.The menu features <p>Mexican Burritos</p>, <n>Central</n>, and <n>American</n> food with a modern twist. This isn’t the type of place that serves guacamole. Instead they specialize in more unique offerings inspired by seasonal ingredients.We started with the Chorizo & Chicken Arepa. An arepa is a <p>corn pancake</p>, and at Bar Takito it has whole kernels of corn. It was then topped with <p>grilled mushrooms</p>, <p>pickled vegetables</p>, <p>vegetarian chorizo</p>, <p>chicken breast</p>, and an <p>aji peanut sauce</p>.The chicken was <n>fried</n> in large pieces, while the chorizo was finely <n>chopped</n>. I really enjoyed the <p>arepa and sauce</p> , but I think that there was a little too much going on here. Next time I would order the <p>Vegetarian Arepa</p> instead.Next up, two orders of <p>tacos</p>. Takito is known for it’s tacos and they lived up to the hype. The menu includes four different types of tacos, which are served in orders of three. We chose to try the <p>Brunkow Cheese</p> and <p>Coffee Braised Beef tacos</p>.The <p>Brunkow Cheese Tacos</p> came with a large piece of <p>grilled brunkow cheese</p>, <p>pickled jicama</p>, <p>arugula</p>, <p>salty peanuts</p>, <p>ahi peanut sauce</p>, and a slice of avocado. The cheese was <n>warm</n> and <n>soft</n> and <n>thick</n>, yet not <n>melted</n>. The <n>texture</n> was great, and the flavor pairing the the <p>peanut sauce</p> and the avocado was <n>fresh tasting</n> and delicious.                                thekittchen.com,",Bar Takito,Chicago
