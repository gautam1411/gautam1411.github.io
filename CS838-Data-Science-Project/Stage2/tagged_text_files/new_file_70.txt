3.7,"Sheffield's is a north side classic. The beer garden is phenomenal and and inside is bigger than it looks. The food is better than average bar food (especially the <p>crispy nachos</p> and <p>grilled cheese</p>) which makes it a great weeknight destination. The beer selection is large and always diverse with good monthly selections. The service can skew a little on the slow side, but as long as you know that going in, it isn't usually an issue (for me at least).,",Sheffield's,Chicago
