3.7,"MY <p>ITALIAN BEEF</p> WAS PREPARED EXACTLY TO MY INSTRUCTIONS. I MADE SURE THE <n>dealing</n> WAS SLOW AT 2 PM, SO THE <n>COOK </n>DIDN'T HAVE TO <n>RUSH</n> MY ORDER. I WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THE SIZE AND FLAVOR OF MY BEEF THAT I EVEN CAME BACK, WHEN I FINISHED EATING AT MY OFFICE, TO GIVE THE CREW A <n>TIPping</n>. I ONLY WISH THAT THE HOT <n>GIARDINAIRed</n> DIDN'T HAVE SO MUCH OIL(I LIKE THE <n>CRUNCHY</n> VEGGIES) IN THE TINY CUPS, EVEN THOUGH IT'S SPECTACULAR ON THE BEEF. GREAT HOT DOG'S AND <p>HOT TAMALE'S</p>. AND THEIR <p> CHICKEN BURGERS </p>WILL MAKE YOU <n>DROOLing</n>, JUST LIKE PAVLOV'S DOG'S. SOMETIME'S IT GETS SHOULDER TO SHOULDER IN HERE, BUT IT'S WORTH EVERY BITE! THEN ENJOY THE <n>artisitc</n> INSTITUTE, AS IT IS ONLY 1 BLOCK EAST OF MAX'S.,",Max's Take Out,Chicago
