4.6,"One of the <n>mythical</n> ice cream shops of Chicago, the original rainbow cone has been a stalwart at Taste of Chicago every year.  But being in Beverly, northsiders like Sam and I have never gotten the chance to try it without making a day out of it.  Luckily we were seeing a comedy show at the Hollywood casino amphitheatre in Tinley park so a quick side trip was in order.  So the deal is that they load up 5 different flavors on one cone for you to give you that patented rainbow look.  I don't know if it's the best ice cream in the world but the flavors went well together.  I never order sherbet so getting some orange was a pleasant surprise.  I'm still not sure what the Palmer house flavor was though.  The coolest part is that they have little cone holders with a little guard to catch any <n>melting</n> ice cream from getting to your hand.  It will happen.  There are a ton of other options like sundaes but we had to get the classic.  Rainbow cone is a must visit for any Chicago ice cream fanatic.  If this was my neighborhood place I'd probably go a few times over the course of a summer.                                  euroatheart.com,",Original Rainbow Cone,Chicago
