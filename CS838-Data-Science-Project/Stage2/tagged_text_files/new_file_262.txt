3.6,"I've been to many <p>ramen</p> places in Chicago. Wasabi was my top one in my mind! Been there three times and each time I was happy with the food and service they provided.The menu has quite different ranges of food starting from appetizers to grilled skewers, from fresh sashimi to all sorts of maki/nigiri rolls, from ramen to rice dish. You can always find something you like.The oyster shot had no alcohol in it. It was more like a <p>ceviche</p> with <p>raw oyster</p>, <p>fish roe</p> and <p>quail egg</p>. Tasted really fresh and smooth.The chicken skin skewers was my favorite since I did enjoy the burnt chicken fat smell as well as the chewy but delicious skin. The other skewers were not bad either, recommended to order few and share.The all sorts of different flavors of <p>sushi roll</p> were really nice too! Fresh ingredients with a little bit traditional/creative ideas. Perfect for sharing as well.As I said, you have to try the ramen! The soup was not <n>salty</n> at all(not like other places) and tasted so good, it was seasoned <n>perfectly</n>! The <p>poached egg</p> was in perfect condition with <n>runny</n> but <p>custard</p> like centre. The <p>pork belly</p> was so <n>tender</n> and full of flavor...I just love everything about this ramen! Wasabi could be pretty busy during dinner time and weekends, recommend make advanced reservation if you can. Hope you will like the ramen and other food there like I do :),",Wasabi,Chicago
