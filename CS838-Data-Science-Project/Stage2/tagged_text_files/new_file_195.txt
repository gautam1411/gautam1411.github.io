4.0,"Enjoyed the food. <p>Chicken chili</p> was good flavor and nice pieces of chicken. I ordered the <p>boneless short rib</p>, it tasted great but the piece of meat was actually higher up on the chuck and for $27 . ( I know my cuts of meat having helped my father for years in his meat market) it was expensive pot roast. The side of <p>roasted corn</p> was good. My other friends had the <p>trout</p> and <p>salmon bread</p> which were hit (trout) and miss (<n>overcooked</n> salmon). The concept is great, the execution needs work especially on quality control.,",Seasons 52,Chicago
