3.5,"This is a great venue for musical acts, and if you_��re a huge fan of the artist(s), don_��t hesitate to splurge on the front row seats _�_ the setting is as intimate as it gets, mere inches away from the performers on stage. We walked around a little before the show, scoping out the _��cheap seats_�� for our next visit _�_ there really aren_��t any _��bad_�� seats in the place, but you wouldn_��t want to be too far along the side walls of the venue. The acoustics were great, the view was decent and the restrooms only a few steps away.�_�_We had front row seats for singer/comedian Stephen Lynch and shared the tiniest of tables with an adorable couple from the _��burbs _�_ to say the tables are _��small_�� is an understatement _�_ think half the size of a folding card table, topped with full place settings for four. Tight. Damn tight. While we introduced ourselves, and laughed off the proximity of our seating, our server extraordinaire recommended an awesome 12-year-old <p>red wine</p> (by the glass, no less!) to my wife and, for me, the first of many (many!) <p>Bulleit Bourbon Old Fashioned cocktails</p>.�_�_We started with some <n>appetizers</n> for the table; the Imported <p>Italian Burrata</p> ($15) featured a massive ball of <n>milky</n>, <n>salty</n> <p>mozzarella cheese</p> and a large portion of olive-oil soaked <p>tommy-toe tomatoes</p> with thickly <n>sliced</n>, <n>perfectly-toasted</n> bread _�_ certainly the highlight of the evening. The <p>Dipping Flight</p> ($13) came with a <n>dollop</n> of <n>flavorless</n> <p>hummus</p>, <n>runny</n> <p>babaganuj</p> and a tiny portion of <n>cold</n> <p>pitas</p>. The <n>Crispy</n> <p>Risotto Balls</p> ($12) were neither <n>crispy</n> or <n>warm</n>, and the <p>goat cheese fondue</p> was set up like a brick of Velveeta. When we handed back our barely touched Dipping Flight and Risotto Balls, our server immediately caught on _�_ and she made up for the faux pas by delivering a round of <n>complimentary drinks</n>.�_�_Sadly, <n>dinner</n> wasn_��t much better. The small ramekin of <n>brownish</n> <p>meat</p> for the Braised <p>Duck Tacos</p> ($13) was cold and tasted like <n>sweetly-sauced</n> <p>barbecued chicken</p>. The plate also featured the smallest white <p>corn tortillas</p> we_��ve ever seen _�_ barely the size of a <p>beer</p> can coaster. The side dish of <p>Fingerling Potatoes</p> ($9) were certainly reheated in the microwave and had a funky <n>lemony</n> back taste. The wife_��s <p>Kale Salad</p> ($12) was nicely portioned and had a large serving of <p>quinoa</p>, <p>croutons</p> and was perfectly dressed with a <n>flavorful</n> anchovy <n>dressing</n>.�_�_During the entire evening, our server was remarkably attentive and, as promised, kept the <p>bourbon</p> coming for the duration of the performance. She was so spot-on, the neighboring table twice leaned in to ask if they could _��borrow_�� our waitress _�_ apparently their server went AWOL between courses. We will certainly return to catch some more shows, but we might opt for dinner elsewhere.,",City Winery Chicago,All Reviews�_9
