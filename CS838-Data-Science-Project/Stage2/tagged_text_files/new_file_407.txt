3.9,"Dinner at Oak Brook lcoation. This was my first time <n>dining</n> here. The menu has a nice variety of <p>steak</p>, <p>seafood</p>, <p>burgers</p>, <p>salads</p>, etc. At the server's recommendation, I tried the <p>Pork Tenderloin</p> with the <p>thai Bang Bang</p>", sauce. Outstanding!! I highly recommend this dish. I am not fond of spicy food and it was not spicy but had great flavor and the pork melted in my mouth. We were celebrating a birthday so again our server (AJ) recommended the <p>carrot cake</p>. Also outstanding and certainly enough for 2-3 people to share. We will definitely dine there again.,J.
