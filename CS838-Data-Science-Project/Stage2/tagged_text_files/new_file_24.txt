4.1,"On South Main Street, Naperville downtown, stands aloof from other Downtown joints stands Hugo's Frog Bar and Fish house. I passed this place many times on my way to Nichols library. I have been postponing my visit to this place for a long time.Back to my lunch, I am greeted , seated and presented with the menu.I have been wanting to try <p>oysters</p> for a long timeAppetizer- Oyster on the Half Shell - Served with <p>frozen Vinegar</p>, <p>horseradish</p> and Sauce was the <n>appetizer</n>. Per the Tom Thomos (waiter) suggestion slurped the <p>oyester</p> with the <p>vinegar</p>, it was <n>pretty good</n> and <n>slimy</n>.<p>Soup</p> was New England Clam Chowder - <n>very tasty</n> with <n>large slices</n> of <p>potato</p>, but could have had more <p>clam chops</p> in themEntree- <p>Sautéed Frog Legs</p>  <p>Basmati Rice</p> & <p>Green BeansLast</p> and only time I had frog legs was a very small <n>sauteed</n> piece of <p>Frog's meat</p> of the size of a qtr <p>chicken nugget</p>.Tom advised me to forgo the cutlery and part with civil ways as I was fighting with the fork and knife. Using bare hands was much better option.The meat is very <n>soft</n> and lightly sauteed and <n>salted</n>. You need to squeeze the <p>lime</p> over the meat and then all the flavors come out.Beware of small joints and bones that are sharpA good part of dining experience is non food as well like, how you are greeted, treated, waited and served.That's where Hugo's Frog Bar and Fish house excels all downtown Naperville eateries.Tom Thomos was excellent in his ways, suggestions and service, hats off to him.,",Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House,Chicago
