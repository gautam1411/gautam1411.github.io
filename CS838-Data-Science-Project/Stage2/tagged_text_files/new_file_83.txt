4.0,"Heavy <n>saucing</n> & nasty bathroom. I think one needs to stay away from anything with sauces at Prairie Moon--both my husband and I had entrees with sauce and the sauce overcame both the chicken and the steak. Our daughter had a burger and that looked good; she certainly enjoyed it. The Ladies' needs a thorough cleaning badly--we couldn't get out of there quickly enough!,",Prairie Moon,Chicago
