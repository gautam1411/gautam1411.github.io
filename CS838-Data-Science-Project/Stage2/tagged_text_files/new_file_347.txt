4,"If you're looking for a country-style ambiance that often has old TV shows playing on a tiny TV well, have I got a place for you! Finding the patio out back is a journey itself. In all seriousness though, I have only come here for brunch and have never been disappointed. The specials tend to be where it's at, with the <p>chorizo chilaquiles</p> being an ok general menu option. I ordered the chicken fried steak with sawmill gravy, potatoes, eggs, and toast. It was quite good, even though I don't tend to be a fan of any gravy. My girlfriend's breakfast chimichangas were huge and delicious when I ate the large amount leftover later that night. Eventually I plan on getting around to the chicken that I suppose they're predominantly known for.,",Feed,Chicago
