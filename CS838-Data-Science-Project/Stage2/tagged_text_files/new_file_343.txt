4.1,"Review for Ruth's Chris Steak House. The food was superb. Felt a little rushed at times to order, but that was probably just good service in that they checked in with us so often. Our servers were very well informed as to the menu and each selection we inquired for further details. The dinner was pricey, but that was what we expected. Overall, a great evening with great food and great service.,",Ruth's Chris Steak House,Chicago
