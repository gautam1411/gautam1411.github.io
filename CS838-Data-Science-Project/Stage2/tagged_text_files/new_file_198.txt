4.2,"Great service and great food. Our server, Jeanette, was wonderful. We had seven people in our group and we wanted to try several dishes but couldn't narrow down our choices. She was attentive to what we wanted and suggested family style among other things. She checked in to make sure we were all doing fine. She put our order in two sets so we weren't overwhelmed with the salads, appetizers, pastas, and entrees we ordered. And at the end when we left we forgot our leftovers she ran outside to give it to us. The food was delicious - our favorite dishes were the <p>mushroom ravioli</p> and <p>mushroom risotto</p>. The <p>ravioli</p> was a well-balanced flavorful dish. The <p>risotto</p> was smoky and creamy but not mushy. The braised <p>lamb shank</p> was very tender and matched well with the <p>saffron orzo</p>. I was looking forward to the <p>butternut squash ravioli</p> but it was just a little too sweet for my <n>palate</n>. Overall though it was great and I'd go back any day.,",Zia's Trattoria,Chicago
