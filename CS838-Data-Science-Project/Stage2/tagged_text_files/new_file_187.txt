3.6,"I'm staying in the area for work. Some coworkers and I decided to try this place. It looked beautiful. Unfortunately it smelled like fish, which I really dislike. But we stayed. I ordered <p>Radiatori del Mezzadro</p>, but I switched it to <p>fettuccini</p> because I like to twirl my pasta! It was delicious. Then I had some <p>tiramisu</p>. It was <n>beautiful</n> and delicious as well. (Had a bite of the <p>chocolate cake</p> too and even that was great!)Even the bread was good!The only down fall was the smell.The service was pretty good as well, even though I didn't get my water refilled. (But I was able to snag an unused one from a coworker)And it wasn't as pricey as it says. A big bowl of pasta and a dessert was $30. Idk how they estimate $150 for two people!t,",Carlucci Rosemont,All Reviewsï¿½_16
