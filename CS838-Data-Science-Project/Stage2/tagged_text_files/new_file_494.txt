4.2,"We stopped in at the Bar on Buena (BOB) this weekend on the 4th of July. It was one of the only restaurants open on the 4th in the Uptown area and came highly recommended from a friend we were with. The 4th was a beautiful day and the BOB had <n>sidewalk</n> <n>seating</n> that has a perfect mix of <n>sun</n> and <n>shade</n>. The BOB was serving a strict brunch-only menu until 3 pm, which was fine because some of us wanted breakfast food, but when a friend asked if they could order their favorite menu item, a simple <p>grilled cheese</p>, the waitress flat out refused. This was the first of the dismal service we experienced while there. Our waitress was outright rude at times (possibly because she was working on a holiday?) and when someone in our party went to the bar to ask for a pen, she was ignored by several staffers who were standing around talking, for several minutes.Luckily, I often find it's the company that makes the experience, so we still had a good time and enjoyed the basic fare. Two of us ordered the Brunch <p>Torta with scrambled egg</p>, <p>guac</p>, and <p>cheese</p> (what could have easily been a grilled cheese if fried, just saying), which was ginormous and filling, if not bland (thank god for <p>siracha</p>). The best thing about this meal was honestly the flavorful <p>jalapeno rice</p> and <p>beans</p>. My husband ordered the <p>Tres Leches French Toast</p>, which sounded fancier than they actually were. We also had several brunch <p>beers</p> and <p>mimosas</p> while there and the BOB seemed to be well-stocked.Overall, I'd give the BOB another chance to try out their dinner menu if in the neighborhood again, but would have little expectations for the service.                                windycity-wanderlust.blogspot.com,",The Bar on Buena,Chicago
