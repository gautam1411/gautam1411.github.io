3.5,"Great summer spot <n>equipped</n> with great patio seating. The food is <n>simple</n> and <n>unassuming</n>, but <n>excellent</n>. My recommendation is the <p>chicken sandwich</p>, <p>hush puppies</p> and a <p>nergoni slushy</p>. You'll probably have to wait to eat, but there's <n>ample</n> <n>seating</n> and entertainment to pass the time.,",Parson's Chicken & Fish,Chicago
