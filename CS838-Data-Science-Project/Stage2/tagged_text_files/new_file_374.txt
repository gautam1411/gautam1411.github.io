3.9,"This is what a <n>breakfast</n> place should be. Everything I've eaten here so far has been great. The <p>omelets</p>, <p>skillets</p>, <p>bennies</p>, <p>pancakes</p> have all been amazing. Waitstaff was helpful and the food came out of the <n>kitchen</n> very quickly (within 5-10 minutes of ordering). Would definitely recommend for anyone in the Schaumberg and surrounding areas to give it a try.,",Egg'lectic Cafe,Chicago
