3.7,"Came here for <n>dinner</n> and had an amazing time. We were a pretty big party and they seated us even though half our <n>party</n> wasn't there yet. Love the modern take on an <n>Italian restaurant</n> which creates a modern feel but still has touched that obviously show this is an Italian restaurant. Very fun <n>upbeat</n> atmosphere and not at all pretentious. The various options of unique <p>bruschettas></p> was amazing! Had the <p>spicy salami</p> and <p>ricotta bruschetta</p> and I was very impressed! <n>Light</n> and <n>delicious</n>. The <p>pasta</p> were delicious without being <p>heavy</p>. The <p>carbonara</p> did not have <p>mushroom</p> and <p>peas</p> unlike all other <p>carbonaras</p> I've had, however, it was definitely delicious, not extremely <p>creamy</p> or <p>salty</p>, light and <p>fresh</p>. Everything we had was light, fresh, and over all delicious. It is the type of place where you can overeat without falling into a food coma. Service was attentive without bring over bearing. Overall had a great time.,",Tre Soldi,Chicago
