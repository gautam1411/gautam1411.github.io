3.8,"Love the Quad-City style! The <p>pizza crust</p> is not too thick,  not too thin and the sauce is so <n>flavorful</n> with just a little kick. You can try something crazy like the <p>Taco Pizza</p>, but I'd suggest just building your own (can get pricey though! ). Also, the <p>mozzarella sticks</p> are amazeballs. Nice ambiance with great big booths and big beet selection!                                                 instagram.com,",Roots Handmade Pizza,Chicago
