3.7,"I must have been missing my home in Texas as I have been on the hunt for great <p>Mexican food</p> on this visit to Chicago. I had tried one place earlier in the year, on Cinco de Mayo of all days, and was just so disappointed that it made me question if the Texas/Mexican food was just that unique that I would have to wait until I was home to enjoy all my favorites. Im happy to report that no that is not the case. Flaco's Tacos is a great option and wonderful pricing to boot. Very friendly service and truly delicious margaritas ensured that I will be returning to sample more form their extensive menu on future trips.                                                nofixedabodeforsue.com,",Flaco's Tacos,Chicago
