3.3,"Overpriced for what you <n>get</n>. We ordered an <p>appetizer platter</p>. $26. They were out of <p>onion rings</p> so they replaced it with <p>Mac and cheese</p>. The past was significantly <n>overcooking</n> and fell apart on the fork. The sauce was somewhat <n>flavorless</n>. There were Bavarian style pretzels with <n>excessive</n> <p>oregano and canned cheese</p> for <n>dipping</n>. The <p>spicy mustard</p> was just odd-tasting. The <p>buffalo wings</p> were ok as were the <p>corned beef sliders</p>",Kitty,Chicago
