4.1,"Frasca is a staple in the Roscoe Village hood as the token pizzeria and wine bar. I have been here many times over the years and have noticed a dip in the quality overall, but to my standards its still pretty darn good.  Recently I tried their <p>brussel sprout pizza</p>, which was seriously lacking any <p>sprouts</p>, but the deliciousness of the <p>caramelized onions</p> made up for it.  Staff is pretty genuine and really can take care of their customers when it comes to crafting drinks or helping you pick out a wine. This is very family and kid-friendly so it's not your average wine bar in the regular sense.  Would like to see some of the quality come back to some of their food that used to be there and please bring back the prosciuto asparagus appetizer you used to serve!  It was delish!                                                northandred.com,",Frasca Pizzeria and Wine Bar,Chicago
