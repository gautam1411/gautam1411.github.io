4.1,"Nice, laid back atmosphere. The menu is very small, but their highlight is the burgers which are very good. The best part about Moody's is the outdoor seating. If you want to drink some cheap beers, eat a burger and fries for $10, and soak in a summer Chicago evening this is the place to go.,",Moody's Pub,Chicago
