3.8,"I was super excited to try Bangers & Lace and I was not disappointed! We walked in and it was seat yourself so we chose a table outside, though I wouldn't have minded inside either as it had a nice ambiance. My boyfriend and I decided to do a shared <n>plates</n>"," kind of meal even though that's not really the style of the restaurant. We started with the soft pretzel which was warm & fluffy (just the way it should be!). It was served with a chocolate stout mustard which complimented it really well. From there, we had the House Sausage Sampler. I'm not usually one to incorporate sausage into my meals, but these were so tasty I was completely satisfied. The sampler came with three types of sausage: Cuban with pickles and two types of mustard (my favorite of the sampler), Italian with marinara and giardiniera, and a duck/bacon sausage served over lettuce with aioli. All three were really good. For dessert we ordered ", which was basically s'mores with bourbon vanilla marshmallows enough for the two of us to split at the end of the meal. The overall experience was positive the wait staff attentive and a place I'd go back to!Also shout out to the group who came in as we were leaving and apologized for being rowdy ��- you weren't! You definitely made our great experience even greater by picking up our bill (I hope you see this!). Thank you!
