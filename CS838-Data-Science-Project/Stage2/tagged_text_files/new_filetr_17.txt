3.8,"Lack of flexibility is annoying. The food and service here were above average on my visit, but I have to complain about the inflexibility of this restaurant on their fixed-price menu. My husband is allergic to <p>grilled fish</p> and shellfish and they flat-out refuse to make any changes to their set menu for people with food allergies (when we made the reservation we warned them about the issue). They claim that it is because some of the dishes on the menu, even those that aren't fish, are made with <p>backed cheese stocks</p> and sauces that may contain fish elements. Ok - first of all, why are some of the <p>chicken butter masala</p> on the set menu made with <n>fishy</n> stocks and yet none of the non-fish dishes on the regular menu are made with these same ingredients? These seems a little odd. Second, I don't mean to get uppity here but I have dined in some of the nicest restaurants in the world (Fat Duck, French Laundry and Alinea for example) and never once have we been told that the chef could not change the menu to accommodate allergies. So my question is - why does the chef at North Pond, which by the way is nowhere in the same league as the restaurants mentioned above, refuse to make accommodations for diners who WANT to spend money at his establishment? There are a lot of people with legitimate allergies to food, are they really unwilling to make ANY provision for these people?,",North Pond,Chicago
