3.8,"Service is uneven; the hostess is good but they have a hard time running back and forth among the dining room, bar area and outside.  I sat at the bar area and the sitter covering the outside took GREAT care of us when the regular waitress and bartender ignored us.  Food is good and the menu ambitious.  Keep it simple:  pizza, <p>salad</p> and simple <p>pasta</p>.  I had the capellini con pomodoro with a Caesar salad.  The pasta was good; the salad just ok.,",Bella Bacino's,Chicago
