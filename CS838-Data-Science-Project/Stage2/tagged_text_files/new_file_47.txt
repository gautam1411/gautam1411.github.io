3.8,"ADORE this place for lunch. They have great <p>soups</p>, <p>salads</p>, and the best sandwiches. I highly recommend Return of the Gyro",. It's heavenly. This is also an excellent place to pick up steaks and such to grill at home. The very best steak I've ever cooked was a dry-aged <p>Slagel Farms strip</p> that we picked up here. Amazing.,Publican Quality Meats
