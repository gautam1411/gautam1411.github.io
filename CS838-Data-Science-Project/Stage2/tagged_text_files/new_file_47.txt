3.9,"<p>Craft beer</p> excellence paired with delicious food. This place is expanding <n>rapidly</n> with the addition of brewery tanks, coffee bar, and retail store. The atmosphere is reminiscent of a European beer hall. Awesome selection of Two Brothers beers all on tap. I found the dinner menu to be very creative; much better than I expected. I opted for three small plates which was plenty of food: <p>Chicken Kebabs</p> (<p>milk zucchini</p>, mushroom, red onion, <p>bell pepper</p> over <p>basil walnut rice</p>); Grouper (<p>blackened snowy grouper</p>, sweet bacon hash, <p>sage beurre Blane</p>); and <p>bison meatballs</p>, <p>north wind cherry BBQ sauce</p>, and <p>zucchini slaw</p>. I would return if my travels bring me back to Aurora.,",Two Brothers Roundhouse,Chicago
