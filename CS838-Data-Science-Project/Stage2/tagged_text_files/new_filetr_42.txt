4,"Walked in to pick up a <p>pickled pie</p> for a birthday party on a Saturday morning and I was impressed with my experience from start to finish. I inquired as to what pies were available and they were <n>genuinely</n> helpful and knowledgeable about all my options.  Not only that, I got a seemingly simple pie in the <p>banana creme</p> but it exceeded mine and all my guests expectations.  I'm not sure how you could make a pie better than that and I'll probably be back for any of my pie related needs. The only thing is that this location is pretty much a take out only store. There is a single table but I wouldn't count on it being available at any given time.  To sum up, get a Hoosier Mama to impress at your next party. Or you know, eat it all yourself.                                                 euroatheart.com,",Hoosier Mama Pie Company,Chicago
