3.9,"I have been searching for a place that reminded me of some West Coast food.  And this was a definite mind blowing experience!  My girl and I shared a plate. She loves eggs so we got the <p>beef patties</p> with white sticky rice, eggs and <n>gravy</n> with a <p>guava strawberry drink</p>. We had a mini plate and it was more than enough! It was my second time trying it!  I will be back soon!,",Aloha Eats,Chicago
