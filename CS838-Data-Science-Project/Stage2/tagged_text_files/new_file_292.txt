3.7,"Worst service ever!!!!!!. Worst service ever!! The waitress forgot about us and once I asked the waitress about the food she said she forgot and got too busy with other customers. I asked for the food again and she apologized and then went and helped out a different table. I was only noticed when I left and went up front to talk to the manager. The manager said my food was finally ready, but that was a lie. We waited and waited and waited. The manager finally came back and offered me a free desert. I told the manager I would take my food to go and pay for. It still was not ready. After waiting more she returned with my order, but there was no <p>corn bread</p> because they didn't make it, the potatoes I have to cook myself because those were not done. The manager suggested I cook them in my oven at home. After waiting some more the manager comped a salad and I am at home waiting for the potatoes to cook. I have never had worse service in my life. I would give them ZERO STARS if it would let me!,",Carson's,Chicago
