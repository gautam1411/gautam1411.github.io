3.7,"A really <n>pretentious</n> place. Server was <n>inattentive</n> and came off as rude. Ordered the <p>egg white omelette</p> which says had <p>turkey</p> and <p>avocado</p>; one piece of <n>tiny</n> <p>famous avocado</p> on a <n>giant</n> <p>turkey filled omelette</p> made it <n>bland</n> and <n>tasteless</n>. Ordered a side of <p>hash browns</p> that was <n>overcooked</n> and <n>charred</n>. A <n>refreshing</n> restaurant name, but doesn't live up to it.,",Summer House Santa Monica,Chicago
