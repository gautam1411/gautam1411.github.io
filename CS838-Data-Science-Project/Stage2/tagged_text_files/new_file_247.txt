3.8,"The other day, I stumbled upon an old Thrillist list that names Lockdown as having the best burger in Ukie Village. OK. It seems a little suspect; they have an array of burgers, all with a ton of craaaaazy, wild shit on them, but the standout one, The Lockdown Warden, is all leeks and cheese. I_��m on board with that. I like leeks. Not to mention the cheese. Although the restaurant_��s website is full of a bunch of metal images and it_��s emblazoned with the Iron Maiden logo, I feel like if a restaurant is brave enough to do something with leeks on a burger, I should go.A cascade of Freddie Mercuries greet me on three televisions as I walk in. That_��s cool. Queen is something we can all agree on, correct? I like to think if I had started up a conversation about _��A Day at the Races_�� with those hard rock kids back in high school, our shoulders might have straightened a little and we might have had a decent conversation.And It_��s a beautiful burger. Lovely to gaze upon. Green, yellow fireworks topped with a <p>pretzel</p> bun. I_��m excited. I am the champion, my readers.But no. It_��s terrible. The meat is doughy. Meat_��s not a carbohydrate. Burger meat should not be doughy. I know, I know it_��s grass-fed beef. Yes, farm to table. But it doesn_��t taste right. And the <p>Merkts cheddar</p>, which has been stuffed inside the patty, squirts out the other end, onto the plate. Not in my mouth. I_��m left with a lot of leeks about as frazzled as I am, and a <n>doughy</n> burger. I scoop up the <p>cheese sauce</p> with my finger in an effort to save myself, but apparently it_��s children and men first because I_��ve not been saved with this action and I_��m drowning in regret.I want to like this burger. No one makes a burger with leeks. If there was a food draft, I_��d like to think that my tribe picked leeks, like, third. The flavor can evolve so deliciously drastically: coyly sweet but crisp one way, warm, mild and tender another. But bite after bite, the leeks seem to further dull the flavor in the rest of the dish. Maybe they were overfried. I had such high hopes once.I assume it_��s me. The burger was too hard rockin_�� for little _��The Shins made me cry once_�� me. Honestly, though, it felt as though the Warden burger was a Loggins and Messina production. Burgers or sandwiches piled high with a pound of crap, even if it_��s one ingredient of crap, was never my scene. I want to taste complexity in the meat. I want to taste the balance of cheese against that burger.thesandwichdamsel.com,",Lockdown Bar & Grill,Chicago
