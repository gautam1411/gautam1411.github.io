3.8,"Siena Tavern will be on our list of restaurants to go back to while in Chicago.  The pasta choices are <n>unique</n>, <n>fresh</n>, <n>tasty</n> and <n>filling</n>. Five people who were all <n>happy</n> with our picks of pasta. The Siena <p>salad</p> is <n>huge</n> so one can be ordered for the whole table. Service is excellent, they all share in making your dinner experience pleasant from the hostess, waiter to the water boy. The reason I didn't give a five star is it is a bit loud but not so much that I would not go back.,",Siena Tavern,Chicago
