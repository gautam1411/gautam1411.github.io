3.2,"I'm Viet and love trying Viet food when I travel. I get it at many major continental US cities, as well as Hawaii, Canada, Paris, and Vietnam. This was one of the best viet restaurants I've been to. They have it all: great food, friendly and attentive service and the price can't be beat! They have a lot of FRESH juices: sugarcane, penny worth... It's my go-to spot in Viet town in Chicago!!!,",Pho Xe Lua,Chicago
