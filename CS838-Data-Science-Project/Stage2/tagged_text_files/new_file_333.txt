3.7,"Sheffield's is a north side <n>classic</n>. The beer garden is phenomenal and and inside is bigger than it looks. The food is better than <n>average</n> bar food (especially the nachos and grilled cheese) which makes it a great weeknight destination. The beer selection is large and always diverse with good monthly selections. The service can skew a little on the slow side, but as long as you know that going in, it isn't usually an issue (for me at least).,",Sheffield's,Chicago
