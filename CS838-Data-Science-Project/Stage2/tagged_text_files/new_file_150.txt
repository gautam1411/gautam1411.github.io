4.0,"Some of the best ice cream in the city! I've gone a few times, and I always gravitate toward the salted caramel. They don't skimp with the ice cream, packing it high on the cone or cup. The prices are fair for the amount of ice cream you're getting too. The space is a little small and there's usually a line during the summer. But in my opinion, it's worth it!,",Bobtail Ice Cream Company,Chicago
