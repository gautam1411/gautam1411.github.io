3.9,"One of the best <n>experiences</n>, anywhere, any time. Was a little <n>leery</n> when my daughter booked a chain"," for a family celebration. I mean, this is Chicago. We don't need to go to a stinkin' chain!Well...Let me get this out of the way: the food was all <n>fabulous</n>! NO complaints whatsoever.But since food is only 50% of the experience for me, the <n>environment</n> and ambience matter a lot.From the second we walked in the front door, the ambience and the service and the staff were the equivalent of that found in the finest NY restaurants.I was floored. After all, this was a ",!Three <n>hostesses</n> were so <n>classy</n> and so trained and so wonderful---handled our arrival and direction to table (we had a big party) seamlessly. We all felt so comfortable.The 2nd tier wait staff were <n>invisible</n> and unintrusive---yet everything was handled.Then came the rise of the curtain. Career server Seth Kayton appeared and it was a one-man theatre production the rest of the way. Classy. Skilled. Knowledgeable. He was a joy.And he comped us dessert as we had a couple of big events we were celebrating AND took our <n>picture</n> and presented it to us. Mama mia.And one thing I remember is that he took care of EACH of us individually and personally as he took care of the entire party. It was something to behold.What a fabulous <n>time</n> we had. NO regrets. Cannot wait to return to Chicago.
