3.1,"I vowed to never go to this place since I walk by it every time I go to my brother's place and I see the constant s*** show outside. Then my girlfriend made me go here to see 3 cover bands (<p>Weezer</p>, <p>Red Hot Chili Peppers</p>, and <p>Sublime</p>). I should've held my ground...It's not that it's a terrible place. The staff are all friendly and fun to talk to, and they'll definitely tell you some of the more ridiculous stories. The problem is the patrons. It's generally a bro-fest, and the night we went we saw our share of ridiculousness. A girl that took her shoes off and was standing barefoot on the sticky floor. Another girl that was basically riding her boyfriend in the middle of everyone. Worst of all, some guy in a hooded sweatshirt that felt compelled to almost suffocate everyone around him with the noxious <n>clouds of farts</n> that he kept letting go.Never again, Cubby <n>Bear</n>. Never again...,",The Cubby Bear,Chicago
