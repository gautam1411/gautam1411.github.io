3.4,"I wasn't totally impressed with this place when I went for the first time. My friends and I had bottle service there on a Saturday night, and that could have been the problem - it was very crowded and very hot. I'm pretty sure the air conditioning was broken. However, the atmosphere was really nice and I was kind of feeling the music. I'd be interested to go back when it's not so crowded and hot.,",Bull & Bear,Chicago
