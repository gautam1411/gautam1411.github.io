3.6,"WORST RESTAURANT IN PALOS. This is the worst restaurant I have ever been too, for food and service. I would not recommend this to my enemies. The only one good thing was sitting on the roof. When we first got there one of the members of our group ordered a glass of <p>White Zin</p>, it was the color of <p>apple cider vinegar</p> and so was the taste, it was sent back. My husband and I ordered a bottle of <p>wine</p> and each of us requested a <p>glass of ice</p> to go with it. My husband got a glass of ice, I did not. We then ordered <p>calamari</p> as an appetizer. It was brought to our table, but none of us had utensils or napkins, so it sat for five minutes until someone could get us utensils. I asked for a glass of ice again. Still don't have it after ten minutes. We then place our food order. Two diners ordered <p>salad</p> and four of us ordered <p>soup</p>. Two diners received their salad and one diner received their soup. The other three of us assumed our soup we be brought out immediately after theirs. Finally our <n>dinners</n> come, we tell them three of us are still waiting for our soup. We told the we would take it to go. I then asked for my glass of ice. Two diners had the <p>salmon</p>, which they said was okay and another diner had the <p>steak</p> which he said was good. One of the other diners had <p>Eggplant Parmesan</p> which she said was extremely <n>soggy</n>. Another diner had the <p>Rigatoni Caprese</p>, which had not taste and the <p>pasta</p> was overcooked. I had the <p>Lemon Chicken</p>, which needed seasoning, I normally do not use <p>salt</p> and this really needed it. The plate was very white, the angel hair <p>pasta</p> was overcooked. We finally got our check and I received my glass of ice. We never did receive our soups to take home. DO NOT GO HERE TO EAT!! The <n>view</n> was nice but that is the only thing that is worth it. If you want really GREAT Italian food, go one block south to Capri, it is the BEST!!! I wouldn't waste my time or money to go here again even if they have a nice view.,","Sam Buca's Restaurant, Bar and Rooftop",Chicago
