3.9,"FOOD: If you know enough math to <n>calculate</n> the permutations, you'll find that B&TB offers you many thousands of possible build-your-own combinations of burgers, spices, buns, and <n>pizza toppings</n>. I narrowed them down by making conservative, classic, heroic choices that reflect the traditional values of middle America. Here's what I wound up with: <p>Natural & Local House Blend Beef</p> with <p>Chicago Steakhouse spice blend</p> on a <p>Split Top Butter Egg bun</p> with <p>American Cheese</p>, <p>Lettuce</p>, Bread & <p>Butter Pickles</p>, <p>Yellow Mustard</p>, <p>lite Mayo sause</p>, and <p>tomato Ketchup</p> _�_ $9.35. Medium-rare. I paid almost $10 for a single burger. Question is, was it $10 good? It was a lot of burger, made with exceptional ingredients. Ten dollars will by you a <p>Double Quarter Pounder</p> with Cheese Meal, plus a <p>McFlurry icecream</p>. Or it will buy you the burger of kick-ass perfection and you get to bring your own beer (because it's BYOB). You do the math. I also had some Homemade <p>Potato Chips</p> _�_ $1.50. I found them to be too greasy. That may reflect my tastes more than the quality of the chips. In any case, I tossed'm. SERVICE: You order and pay up front, then find your own seat and they find you when your burger's ready. Usually that means you'll never see a server again once you get your food. Not the case at B&TB. They came around a couple times to see how things were going. FAVORITE: Hand-Cut <p>Kennebec Fries<\p> _�_ Lg. $5.50. These are the type that taste boldly like a potato, and not merely like a <n>fry</n>."," <n>Exceedingly</n> good. YOU SHOULD TRY: <p>Filbert's Root Beer</p> _�_ $3.00. A local brew with a four-generation, south-side history. <n>Refreshing</n>. Great with your burger if you're not <n>drinking</n> beer-beer.                                makeitlikeaman.com",Butcher & The Burger
