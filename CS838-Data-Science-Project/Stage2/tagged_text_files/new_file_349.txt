3.7,"This place is forever engrained into the very spirit of Stevenson students after their graduation, half for the proximity to City Park, and half for the Kona Grill happy hour. I went with a friend several weeks ago and had a few strong drinks and some incredibly discounted sushi to boot. The server was very attentive constantly checking in on us and ensuring we were happy. I will without a doubt be back soon!,",Kona Grill,Chicago
