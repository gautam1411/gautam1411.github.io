3.9,"My favorite <p>pizza</p> place in Chicago so far! Located just up the street from me, it's an easy take-out option. However, I recently <n>dined</n> in and was so charmed by the atmosphere. It's practically a hole in the wall, set back into a nondescript building and next to one of the shadiest bars (Drop) I've ever been in. Once inside though, it's the coziest pizza spot! <p>Half Ditka</p> (all the meats), <p>half popeye</p> (<p>spinach</p>, <p>tomatoes</p>, <p>feta</p>, <p>mozz</p>) is my order. They also have great <p>pastas</p>! Highly recommend to anyone that lives in the Old Town/lower LP area.,",Bricks,Chicago
