3.8,"Great service! It's bar food in a high end setting. Came here every Friday for their awesome food specials when I lived in Lincoln Park. They have tons and tons of craft beers on draft and over 100 TVs. I hear people rave about their trivia nights.. still have to go on a Tuesday, though! Fun spot on the weekends, especially when there's a game on. Just try to come early to save a spot!,",State Restaurant,Chicago
