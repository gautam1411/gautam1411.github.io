Our waiter was extremely knowledgable of the menu and offered great advice and help in ordering. <p>Craft beer</p> and wine list is impressive and certainly will help you find your happy place",". We ordered blackened ribeye, Bbq brisket on top of jalapeÍ±o corn bread, and the buttered bbq shrimp. Needless to say all were outstanding. Finished it off with dessert and chicory coffee while enjoying the bluegrass band. What a great night!",Maple Tree Inn
