4.0,"Great for Large Parties!. Thank you so much to Texas de Brazil waitstaff and the events manager, Elizabeth. We recently came in with a party of 15 to celebrate a graduation. The events manager was extremely helpful in reserving our choice of private room and creating a package dinner that fit the needs of our group.The food was delicious as always. This style of dining works out so well for large parties. Every member of my party was served hot food at the same time. We all had a very good meal. I would highly recommend this location to others for small or large parties. Thanks again. You made my job easy.,",Texas de Brazil,Chicago
