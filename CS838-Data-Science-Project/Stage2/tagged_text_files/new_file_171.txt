3.4,"Reasons why I will not be returning to <p>bacon</p> and eggs: After being a frequent customer for a number of times, it is unfortunate that our waitress was rude enough for my whole family to not want to ever come back. Food is important but can be overshadowed with rude service. I do not even know her name because she never offered it. I recommend any other waiter/waitress besides her. I am honestly disappointed with her, while the rest of the staff is pleasant. She is Caucasian, wears glasses, short hair tied in a pony tail, tattoos on her arms, and medium build. The waitress seemed overwhelmed with her duties. She was anything but courteous or decent. Literally left a bad <n>taste</n> in my mouth.1. Demanded we move our stroller bc she couldn't deal with its placement.2. Rude while my mother and sister in law placed their <n>orders</n>. The waitress seemed frustrated, unwilling, and impatient with first time customers.3. The waitress had a Bitchy attitude while I was trying to pass with my son who has a monitor. I guess I was in her way while I was trying to make my way to the bathroom with my son.4. Lastly Ignored order of wife and gave attitude when asked about the order (side of <p>sausage</p>),",Bakin' & Eggs,Chicago
