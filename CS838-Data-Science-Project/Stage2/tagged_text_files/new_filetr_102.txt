3.9,"This is what a breakfast place should be. Everything I've eaten here so far has been great. The omelets, skillets, bennies, pancakes have all been amazing. Waitstaff was helpful and the food came out of the kitchen very quickly (within 5-10 minutes of <n>ordering</n>). Would definitely recommend for anyone in the Schaumberg and surrounding areas to give it a try.,",Egg'lectic Cafe,Chicago
