3.7,"We stopped in last night after work for drinks and appetizers. I was disappointed they haven't jumped on the Happy Hour train yet and they didn't have any specials. But I really liked the cocktail I ordered, the Mistress - a cool, refreshing grapefruit flavored drink. If you like grapefruit, you'll love this cocktail. My husband got the <p>Blueberry Vandermill Cider</p> and got a free State/Lake coosie with each can.For food we tried the Poutine, <p>Pimento Cheese Dip</p> with Chips, and Soft Pretzel with Red Pepper and Goat Cheese Dip. The Poutine came with bacon and peas and was super cheesy and delicious, not weighed down in gravy like Poutine can be. The <n>Pimento Dip<\n> was good, but far and away, the real winner was the pretzel with goat cheese and red pepper dip. It tasted like a jalapeͱo popper without being fried, and the pretzel was crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside. I don't usually like goat cheese, but I loved this. And the presentation of all the dishes was creative. The only downside was the service. Apparently we got caught in a shift change and had quite the time trying to track someone down to pay our bill (like 20+ minutes of waiting for someone give our money to). Luckily the food and drinks were on point, so this didn't sully our experience too much.                                windycity-wanderlust.blogspot.com,",State and Lake Chicago Tavern,Chicago
