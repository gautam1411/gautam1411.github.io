3.6,"My husband and I went out to <n>dinner</n> to celebrate a fantastic Cubs victory and were seriously disappointed in the service here.  We sat in the restaurant side and waited for 20 minutes before we left.  No one came to take our drink order, no one stopped over to say that they'd be right with us, nothing but free <p>bread</p> and water refills.  After a party of four came in and was waited on in less than five minutes, we left.  Harry Caray would be embarrassed to be associated with this place!,",Harry Caray's Italian Steakhouse & Bar,Chicago
