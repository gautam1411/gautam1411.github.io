3.7,"Try the beer sampler. It has variety and taste and it's cheap. Vampire fries (with garlic sauce) is amazing along with mozzarella sticks. All entrees have huge portion sizes so be careful unless you want to take them home. Would not recommend nachos but all other appetisers are good enough. Nice ambience with outdoor seating is available. The place is a little difficult to locate and feels secluded,",Ram Restaurant & Brewery,Chicago
