3.8,"3 visits in a month-that possibly says it all. The first visit was more of a try, especially since Green Basisl offers my very fav Fried <p>Ice Cream</p>. Of course amongst the appetizers, we loved <p>Chicken Satay</p> and the <p>Thai Fish Cake</p> (just 5 pieces but tasty enough). And tried <p>Thai fried rice</p> a couple of times and the <p>Thai Green curry</p> once.Lunch is crowded, but dinner was more peaceful.And yes, my <p>fried ice cream</p> is just too good.,",Green Basil Thai Restaurant,Chicago
