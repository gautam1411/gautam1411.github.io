3.7,"Excited about the menu. Played it safe with the <p>panko chicken</p>, but the sides were delicious. Saw fries pass by with another patron and I wanted to take them - definitely getting <p>fries</p> next time...Â Food came out quick and the patio served its purpose well. Prices were solid!The service was a little abrupt and awkward - for myself and other customers ordering as well. Not a huge deal, but a part of the experience that was worth noting.I plan to go back and would recommend this to anyone.,",BopNgrill,Chicago
