4.0,"Nice place.. We visited with family on a Sunday afternoon. The place is nice, clean, and well appointed. All the staff was nice to us also. I had the <n>Celtic combination</n>, which was smaller portions of <p>lamb stew</p>, <p>fish</p> and <p>chips</p>, and <p>corned beef</p> and <p>cabbage</p>. The lamb stew was excellent and worth a return, as was the corned beef and cabbage. However, the fish was dreadfully bad. Almost all <n>breading</n>, very <n>greasy</n>, no <n>fish flavor</n>. 3 of us at the table had fish and chips and all agreed it was basically inedible. The kids had <p>hamburgers</p> and they were pleased. There was a guitarist playing who was very enjoyable. We would return, definitely, we just would avoid the fish.,",Celtic Knot Public House,Chicago
