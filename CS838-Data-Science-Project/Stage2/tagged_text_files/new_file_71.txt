4.0,"Part of my food coma trip to Chicago.  1/2 block from the train station makes it an easy place to get dinner.  Interior decor was quite nice, the only thing that might have made it better was a bit more of a cozier feel, but that is personal preference, it was open and airy and when the place is full I am sure that is a good thing.  I was a bit early for dinner so only about 1/3 of tables were in use during my visit.  Wait staff was very very pleasant and my waitress gladly charged my phone for me while I ate.  They were very helpful in me deciding which of the dishes to enjoy.  The food was <n>fabulous</n>... had been about 10 years since I had an <n>Ethiopian</n> place to eat at, so it was extra good.  Service was prompt and friendly and the food tasted wonderful to me.  Everything was clean and nice. Added bonus it is literally across the street from the Green Mill jazz club... made for a perfect evening.,",Demera Ethiopian,All Reviews 13
