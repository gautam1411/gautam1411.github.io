3.9,"Lakeview/Chicago brunch staple. Clear your schedule for the rest of the day, eat the <p>Cinnamon Roll</p> and take a nap. I've had a couple of the omelette specials here - portions are big and food is good. I've always had friendly, pleasant service and the price is right. Because it is such a popular place, people are crammed in like sardines, which can be a little uncomfortable when seated by young children, but hey, it is Lakeview.,",Ann Sather,Chicago
