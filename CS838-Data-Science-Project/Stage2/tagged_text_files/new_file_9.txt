My final analysis is that <p>Shake Shack</p> is considerably better more <n>juicy</n>, <n>tastier</n> etc.  it is also about 60 cents more but worth the taste premium.M Burger is still a decent <p>veg cheese burger</p>, however, and certainly better than <p>McDonalds Burger</p> or Burger King or A&W.,",M Burger,All ReviewsÂ 11
