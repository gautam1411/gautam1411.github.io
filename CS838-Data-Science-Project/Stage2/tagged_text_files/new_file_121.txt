4.0,"The hubs and I were lucky enough to snag a reservation for New Years Eve at Anteprima.  He had never been, and after dining on their beautiful and cozy outdoor patio last summer with some friends, I knew I had to take him.The atmosphere was bustling without being overwhelming.  It was intimate, cozy, and just what we were looking for on our first NYE with just the two of us.They have an extensive wine list, but I stuck to beer (<p>Peroni</p>) as I'm a beer gal.  We started with <p>roasted root vegetables</p> with <p>hazelnuts</p> and <p>rosemary oil</p> which despite being pretty simple was delicious.  We also had the <p>octopus</p> with <p>potatoes</p>, <p>red onion</p>, <p>chilis</p>, <p>parsley</p>, <p>lemon</p> and <p>olive oil</p> - this dish is out of this world - it has a <n>smoky</n>, <n>tangy</n>, bold <n>herbaceous</n> flavor that is perfection.  You must order this dish.For entrees we had the orecchiette with spicy house made lamb sausage, bitter greens, chilis and pecorino as well as the rigatoni with soppressata and ricotta - the pasta was cooked perfectly in both dishes.  The pasta with lamb sausage had delicate flavors that melded together to form an earthy, savory dish that I will order again and again.  The rigatoni had really bright and bold flavors that truly wowed us.  The saltiness of the soppressata against the <n>sweetness</n> of the <p>tomatoes</p> and the <n>creaminess</n> of the ricotta was amazing.  I honestly don't know that I could pick a favorite between these two!Overall, awesome, tasty experience.  I already can't wait to go back.",Anteprima,Chicago
