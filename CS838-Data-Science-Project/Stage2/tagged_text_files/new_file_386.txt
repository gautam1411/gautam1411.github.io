3.6,"On Sunday, they offer <n>brunch</n> menu. I guess less items but keep the popular ones. This is our first time, so we decided to try the famous <p>fat rice</p>"," and along with two small <p>entrees-beef croquettes</p> and house-made <p>dumplings</p>. The <p>croquettes</p> was made of <p>mashed potatoes</p> and had a little bit <p>curried beef</p> mince in it, deep frying made it crunchy outside but still soft inside. As soon as I tasted the dumplings, I knew it was handmade. The skin was thicker and more chewy, we loved it with little bit <p>chili sauce</p>. Ok, the ",! It was very overwhelming in a good way! It is a mix of everything-BBQ <p>pork sausage</p> curry <p>chicken</p> <p>prawn</p> clam <p>olives</p> etc.The <p>rice</p> was hidden underneath cooked with <p>shredded duck</p> and <p>Chinese sausage</p> plus  sweet & sour <p>grapes</p>. The every component was very delicious especially the rice a combination of full flavors! You have to try it!!!!! The size is perfect for 3-4 ppl. The dessert part we especially enjoyed the portuguese <p>egg tart flaky shell </p> <p>creamy custard</p> filling nothing is better than that. This place is definitely worth trying. Love to go back and try more different dishes!
