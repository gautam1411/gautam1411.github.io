4.0,"There are plenty <n>Irish bar</n> around the city and you get bore going there to enjoy a <n>good</n> beer and hear same musical vibes. <n>Duke of Perth</n> is a great Scottish bar. I loved their <p>beer</p> and <p>whiskey</p> selection. They have a small patio in the back yard it's a nice. Their speciality is <p>Fish & Chip</p>. Beer battered <p>fried cod</p> served with <p>peas</p> and <p>chip</p>. Totally in love with it. Good job guys. Keep it up,",Duke of Perth,All ReviewsÂ 5
