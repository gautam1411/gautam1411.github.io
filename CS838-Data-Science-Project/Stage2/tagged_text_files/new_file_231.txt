3.4,"All about 3 little pigs. I went here while visiting from australia and loved it. its set up in railway carriages and when I got there it wasn't opened yet but there was a bar in another carriage that was so I had a few drinks here first. After that I went to the dining carraige to eat. I had been looking forward too the 3 little pigs burger for some time and and wasnt disappointed. 3 different types of pork in one massive burger topped with fried egg. Highly recommended and I would deffinately come back here.,",The Silver Palm,Chicago
