3.5,"Our most recent visit to Chicago has us staying with my cousin, who lived in Lincoln Park. During the day we were searching for a place nearby that we could get gluten-free food, and Homeslice came up on our search. And, it was within walking distance!We arrived during happy hour and started with some delicious cider and the Jalepeno Homies which were <n>grilled</n> jalapenos stuffed with cheese and bacon and accompanied with BBQ sauce.´è_´è_The gluten-free pizza was delicious, and we loved their combinations of pizza as we ate the Lew-Wow and Mercenary! I also got their <p>Buffalo Chicken salad</p> (but subbed ranch instead of bleu cheese), which was great for a pizza place, being made with fresh spring greens, and lots of fresh veggies.´è_´è_We enjoyed this place so much, that we came back a second time during our 6 day trip to Chicago!monikamcmahon.com,",Homeslice,Chicago
