4,"The best food in Chicago. Simply put: if you like authetic homemade food, it doesn't get better than this. Chicken was so crispy, <n>juicy</n> and perfect (had the white chicken), <p>roasted waffles</p> were vanilla <n>hinted</n> and cooked to perfection, syrup <n>complimented</n> both of them really well. Had the Mac and cheese and greens, both were outstanding and infused with flavor perfectly (especially the greens). Lastly but not least, the host who seated us was the most hospitable person you could imagine - ensured we had a great time and were seated promptly.Will definitely come back to Chicago just to eat here in the future - it was that good.,",Chicago's Home of Chicken & Waffles,Chicago
