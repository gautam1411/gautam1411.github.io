4,"I think I need to give this place a second chance and try the sushi this time. The service is prompt and courteous, the ambiance is great, the outdoor seating is great but that's where all the positive stops for me. My friend received a dirty spoon for your <p>miso soup</p>. And it didn't get any better after that. We had noodle dishes which I think might be our error. The food was lacking. Over cooked seafood, bland flavorless dishes  and nothing to rave about. I have heard the sushi is great but unfortunately I didn't have sushi and therefore was disappointed. With so many options I don't know if I want to give this place a second shot.,",Kansaku,Chicago
