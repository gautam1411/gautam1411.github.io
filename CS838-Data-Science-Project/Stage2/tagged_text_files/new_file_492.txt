3.8,"Went to both M Burger and <p>Shake</p> <n>Shack</n> yesterday and compared equivalent <p>burgers</p>.  My final analysis is that Shake Shack is considerably better more <n>juicy</n>, <n>tastier</n> etc.  it is also about 60 cents more but worth the taste premium.M Burger is still a decent <p>burger</p>, however, and certainly better than <n>McDonalds</n> or <n>Burger King</n> or A&W.,",M Burger,All ReviewsÂ 11
