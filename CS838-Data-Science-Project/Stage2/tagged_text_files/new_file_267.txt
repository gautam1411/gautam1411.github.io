3.6,"Simply the best <n>Combo</n> in the world. Perfect in every way, the gold standard in Italian Beef. Gravy is just right on the Italian spices, beef has correct bite to it, sausage is from Chicago (they're all good In Chi town), <p>giardiniera</p> is is perfectly hot and the bread is strong enough to stand up to a double dunk.
