4.0,I absolutely love this place! I had the most amazing vegan chocolate cake!! The buttercream, tasted like ,. I am not a desert person and for me to rave about a cake says a lot. The place is really warm and inviting. My meal was all vegan and I have to say I was impressed with most of it. I would recommend and I would go back.
