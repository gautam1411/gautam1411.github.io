4.0,"Worst <n>Service</n> I have ever experienced in my life, and I am not a spring <p>chicken</p>. I had eaten here twice, the first experience was so bad I didn't want to go back because Candance W. was my server and she was bad the first time. My friend wanted to try the <p>pizza</p>, so I gave it another shot... Huge mistake! We ended up with the same bad <n>server</n> and we sat there for 1 hour and 45 minutes waiting on 3 small <p>pizza's</p> that, after we asked, only take 15 min to make.... My daughters <p>cheese pizza</p> was burnt and I requested another one, the Manager Dave, came to our table to confront me in an argumentative manor telling me the pizza was not burnt, that is the way they serve their <p>pizzas</p>. My pizza was not burnt and when I pointed that out to him he became angry and said, he could not explain that one, but the cheese pizza was not burnt. It was burnt all around. I told Dave, fine we will just take it I didn't want to argue, Dave then said, No the pizza is mine now.... and jerked the pizza out of my hands and borderline assaulted me. What a professional Manager...(not) Dave must have told the kitchen not to make the rest of our order because we sat there waiting for it. We had to ask for the remade <p>cheese</p> and my friends little pizzas. Needless to say, I will never go back to Silo unless they hire professional Managers and servers. The food was not good enough to endure those types of attitudes.,",Silo Restaurant,Chicago
