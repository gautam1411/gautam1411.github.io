3.8,"Tried <p>Toast</p> this morning with the fiance. I am a big Eggs Benedict person and try it pretty much everywhere I go. At Toast I tried their <p>grilled tenderloin benedict</p>. <p>Hollandaise sause</p> is hit or miss at most places but they hit it. They add a little bit of truffle to the sauce which gave it a nice little twist, but not over powering. My fiance ordered the pancake orgy, which had tons of <p>fruit</p> and a nice <p>yogurt</p> drizzle. We also added the a side of <p>oatmeal</p> that I thought was great for oatmeal. And she added a side of <p>apple pear</p> and <p>brie crepe</p>. She enjoyed it but it wasn't my cup of <p>tea</p>. Reminded me of what a dirty wet towel smells like. But overall a good experience, good service, slightly overpriced. Enjoy, Eat Drink & be Merry!,",Toast,Chicago
