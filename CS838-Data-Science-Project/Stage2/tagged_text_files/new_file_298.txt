3.5,"Love this place. Family owned and great food.�_ They have A private room in the back that we had for our party.�_ First in the bar area they had half price wine I guess on Sundays and Mondays, and half price apps for happy hour during the week.�_ Our service was spectacular, great ambiance.�_ Fire pits outside to smoke a cigar go great with the live music in the bar.�_ Definetly will be back. Great Job,",Chicago Prime Steakhouse,Chicago
