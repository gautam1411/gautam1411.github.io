3.7,"My friends and I were <n>thoroughly</n> <n>unimpressed</n> with our <n>dining</n> experience at Dusek���s Board and Beer on the 17th of May, 2016. I flew into Chicago from Cambridge to celebrate my best friend���s birthday with his family and partner. We hoped to go out for a nice meal. Having been recently promoted to a one-star Michelin restaurant, we were excited to secure the reservation. In hindsight, we should have gone elsewhere. A truly dismal experience from the reservation process through payment.��ServiceAwkward staff with a knack for oversight on details. I spoke with the reservationist and informed her of the birthday celebration. She said she would send out a dessert. This never arrived, nor did any mention of the birthday.��We also indicated we were going to be sharing all dishes, and at numerous times throughout the meal, we found ourselves with too few plates. Towards the end of the meal, our server left one plate with no cutlery at the table���our party size was 5.Our server knocked over the sauce for the Mussels and it splashed onto my glass and the table below. No attempt at cleaning up the mess was made, only an unintelligible squawk escaped our server���s mouth.��Later in the evening, out server knocked my water glass over causing water to spill onto my lap. At least this time he was apologetic.��FoodBy far the <n>worst</n> one-star Michelin experience I have had of the 10 Michelin-star restaurants at which I have dined. The food wasn���t bad, per se, but it was significantly subpar to the Michelin standard. Gilt Bar and Girl and the Goat which only have Bib Gourmand status blow Dusek���s food quality out of the water.,",Dusek's,Chicago
