4.0,"Super cheap eats! Basic <p>Bahnmi with BBQ pork</p> being consistently good, with the right mix of sweet to <n>smoky</n>to <n>savory</n>. Can be a bit dry as they keep it really simple with meat, <n>pickled</n> veggies, <p>vegetarian cilantro</p> and <p>jalape√±o bread</p>. Still a way better bang for your <n>buck dish</n> than say a Jimmy Johns and your taste buds will thank you.,",Ba Le Sandwich Shop,Chicago
