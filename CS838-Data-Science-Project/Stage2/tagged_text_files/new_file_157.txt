4.1,"One of the best place in Chicago to get <p>Thai food</p>. The ambience is so pleasing and the Food in this place is really awesome and out of the world, service is a bit late but you will forget it when you taste their food. My suggestion would be -chicken wonton and check for no 52 in the menu if you love hot spicy food.,",Opart Thai House,Chicago
