Matching <p>Rose wine</p> the recommendation was just right. <p>Quiche</p> just as good as the scallops. Restaurant wasn't busy during our visit - service was good, the owner took our order and was interested in hearing of our experience and asked us to stop in again. We will.,",Cafe Central,All ReviewsŒæ6
