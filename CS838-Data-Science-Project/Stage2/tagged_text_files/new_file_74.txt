3.6,"Went for lunch and overall a pretty good experience. Limited menu and wine list- that said selections were were well matched. <p>Scallops with black beans</p>, salad and chocolate mousse was <n>prepared</n> and <n>presented</n> very well. <n>Matching</n> <p>Rose wine</p> the recommendation was just right. Quiche just as good as the scallops. Restaurant wasn't <n>busy</n> during our visit - service was good, the owner took our order and was interested in hearing of our experience and asked us to stop in again. We will.,",Cafe Central,All Reviews´è__6
