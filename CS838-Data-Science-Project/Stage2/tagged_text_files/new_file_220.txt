3.2,"This place is amazing! The views of the city are so beautiful and the atmosphere is just relaxed and fun. Had the <p>duck</p> and the <p>suckling pig</p> and was blown away. However, the cocktails are what make this place. I will definitely be back to try more cocktails from the menu. This place does not disappoint.,",GreenRiver,Chicago
