3.5,<n>Terrible</n> customer service!My wife and I bought a Groupon to try this place out. The Groupon was good Sunday through Thursday only. We went there on a Sunday evening and paid $4 to park. When we got out of the car and walked up to the door there was a printed off sign taped to the door that said No Groupon's This Weekend.," When we asked the hostess she said that the owner didn't want to allow the Groupon deal to be used, even though it was Sunday and according to the TOC we should've been able to use the deal.There are a lot of places to eat in Chicago, we will not be going back here.",Blue Agave
