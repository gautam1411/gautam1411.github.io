3.6,"I had heard a lot about this place, so I was able to make to stop by to filter our many beers at the nearby Revolution Brewing Taproom. The menu offers <p>chicken pieces</p>, wings, or <p>sandwiches</p>. I went with a <p>boneless breast sandwich</p>. The piece arrived with a delicate, crunchy honey based batter coating, and a side of extra honey butter. Spreading the butter on the chicken, I felt like I had just discovered a new world.The focus throughout the menu is on locally sourced food where possible. Drinks menu is Chicago-area beers, although there is <p>still Miller</p> or Tecate for the <n>stubborn</n>, even the <p>soda fountain</p> has locals like Green River, all featuring 100% <p>cane sugar</p> (except for Diet Coke cans). Has a big repetitional locally, but I can still bring out of town friends to this as a secret discovery.<p>Honey Butter Fried Chicken</p>"
