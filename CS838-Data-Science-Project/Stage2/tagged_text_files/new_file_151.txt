3.9,"I have been eating here for over 5 years. Essentially, this place is a fast food sushi joint with decent sushi at reasonable prices. This is a good place to go if you are tired of the $15 special"," rolls at most sushi places. Just don't expect much in the way of service as it sucks, especially when they get crowded. They rudely rush you like crazy and have an attitude if you don't like them forcing you out of your seat.  I once asked for a cup with a lid for my 3yr old.  The waitress brought over a styrafoam to-go cup and tried to charge me extra for it.",Sushi Station
