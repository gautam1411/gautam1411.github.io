3.7,"A stop on my food coma trip to Chicago.  Ambiance and decor gets a 7 on the 5 point scale.  Absolutely loved it.. all the different feels to the different spaces yet not disjointed.  Was here on a Tuesday and had the Prix Fixe menu.  For $35 it was a steal of a deal.  Wine was 1/2 off of some bottles.  The food was prepared very well.  I had read some reviews on yelp that made it sound uneven, but mine and my dinner companions meals were spot on.  The only thing I would say is one of my pieces of steak was a tad tough, the others were perfect.  The staff was wonderful as well.  I had the impression that the club might be on the pretentious side with some saying they were declined entry - my friend had been out walking all day and was in running shoes with her slacks, so I was wondering what would happen when we walked in... we were warmly greeted with good-natured bantering (always a plus for me) and directed down the stairs for a lovely evening.  There was a guest that either had some social skill issues or was a tad drunk and a bit too loud - that was the only downside to the night - it was not to the point the staff really should have stepped in, or I am sure they would have, it was just that booth that having your druthers, you would not be next too... had they stepped in it would have been heavy handed, so again props to them in knowing that fine fine line.
