3.8,"Lady Gregory's is right up there with Hopleaf as my favorite spot in Andersonville.  It's got a great Irish pub vibe and you really do get a relaxed and causal feel once you step inside.  The thing about <n>Lady Gregory's</n> is that you'll be happy whether you're coming here for the food or just to have some <p>beers</p>.  I've never been disappointed by anything I've ordered here.  I will say the <p>truffle chips</p> are a classic and you need to try them.  <p>Bleu cheese</p> and <n>truffle oil</p> on homemade chips that are fried just right.  Two thumbs up here.  I also love the <p>Lobster mac and cheese</p>,  because sometimes I feel like pretending I'm fancy when eating kid food.  But seriously, with the <p>mushrooms</p> and more truffle it's a great bite.I've come in just to watch a game at the bar and have some beers too.  They have a rotating number of craft beers to pick from and I've always been able to get a few new beers.  And if there is one thing I love, it's trying new beers.If you're in Andersonville and looking for a neighborhood spot to get drinks and solid food, Lady Gregory's is your place.                                euroatheart.com,",Lady Gregory's,Chicago
