3.7,"Great Breakfast and Service. The seven of us were in on a Sunday morning. Endless coffee and water without any of us even raise our hand. Food were great. Good place for breakfast. I can only say for breakfast since none of us has been there for lunch nor dinner. I will sure be back again.,",Buffalo Restaurant & Ice Cream Parlor,Chicago
