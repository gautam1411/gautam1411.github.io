When we arrived, the young lady (our server) had a table all ready with <p>water</p> poured and <p>salsa</p> and chips ready. As we were deciding, the <n>Chef</n> came and introduced himself, happily explained and encouraged his specials. We settled on the <p>Al Pastor tacos</p> and the <p>Fiesta Mole Enchiladas</p> (Chef's recommendation). He confidently alerted us that moles are his specialty. The food was <n>incredibly</n> delicious. We STRONGLY recommend New <p>Rebozo</p> on Superior. The <p>margaritas</p> were really good, the <p>guacamole</p> was good. The <p>salsa</p> was Amazing!-----17 Nov, 2014-----Fiesta Mole Enchiladas. Delicious!Had the Chef's seasonal, personal picks.,",New Rebozo Chicago,Chicago
