4.1,"Great flavor, super <n>affordable</n>, and best of all: BYOB. Definitely get the baba ghannouj and a falafel wrap. ï¿½_I'm not a big fan of <p>lentil soup</p>, but every time I go, someone I'm there with gets it and raves about it. Service the last time I went was a little slow (only one waitress) but I've also called ahead for pick-up before and my order was hot and ready on time.,",Semiramis,Chicago
