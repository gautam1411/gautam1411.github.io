3.9,"I would rate it a 4.5 if we didn't have to wait over 30 minutes even though we made a reservation. Other than that the place was very good. Our waitress was great and the food was delicious. Would definitely recommend this place, just make sure to make a reservation because it gets extremely busy.,",Ted's Montana Grill,Chicago
