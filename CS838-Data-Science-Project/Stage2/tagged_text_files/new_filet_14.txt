3.6,Stopped on our road trip. After seeing them on diners drive ins and dives and we are really glad we did. After living in Chicago for several years I had tried a <p>Chicago dawg</p>, and wasn't sure I would like it but we got the <n>Chicago style</n> with <p>hot peppers</p>. It was great!!!! We also like the <p>fried vegetables</p> and were pleasantly surprised to find <p>creamed corn</p>. If we lived here we would definitely be back...,Superdawg Drive-in
