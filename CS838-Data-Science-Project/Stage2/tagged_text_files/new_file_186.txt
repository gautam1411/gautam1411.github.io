3.8,"Disappointing. Both our <n>entrees</n> were underdone. No excuse for an expensive steak house. They added some crab to <p>French fries</p> and called it a dish. Really?? The service was excellent but a bit stuffy. One usually gets what you pay for, but not in this case.,",Sullivan's Steakhouse,Chicago
