4.0,"Solid breakfast offerings with many variations on each theme-- <p>Egg Skillets</p>, <p>Pancakes</p>, <p>French Toast</p>, <p>Omelets</p>, etc. A couple standouts for us were the <p>Ghirardelli Chocolate Chip Pancakes</p>, the <p>Hash Browns</p> and the <p>Hot Chocolate</p> with mointainous helping of whipped cream. <p>Eggs Benedict</p> were just meh, with a <n>Hollandaise</n> that had little to it. <p>Corned Beef Hash</p> tasted like it was out of a can. An ok place if you find an dish or two you favor and return for specifically, but I probably would not be a regular.,",Burnt Toast,Chicago
