3.9,"Spendy, but decent and convenient.Went here for a late lunch while shopping.A very wide variety of food is served cafeteria style. And the food quality isn't bad.You also get to eat right away.The only drawback is that it's not cheap.But it is in Watertower Place, where nothing is cheap.,",Mity Nice Grill,Chicago
