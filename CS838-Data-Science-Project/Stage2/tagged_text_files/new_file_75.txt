4.3,"I have seen this restaurant many times while walking downtown Naperville. It looked <n>quiet</n>, <n>quaint</n>, and <n>pretty</n>. I was taking my adopted"," mom for her birthday lunch in Naperville, so I suggested this place. She agreed and off we went!They placed us by the window and it was perfect. The ambience by the window was so pretty as we looked outside and got ray of sunshine on us. It was nice. They gave us a dinner menu by mistake and while we were deciding, they switched our menu to a lunch menu. We could still get the dinner stuff if we wanted to. My mom already had her heart set on a <p>dinner pasta</p>. I started to flip and flop. I ended up getting a <p>meatball sandwich</p> from the lunch menu while at first I wanted a <p>chicken dish</p>.We also ordered <p>calamari</p> for <p>appetizer</p>. It was really really good. It looked pale with very <n>thin</n> <n>breading</n>. However, when you ate them... So good! They're <n>super tender</n>, <n>flavorful</n>, <n>humongous</n>! They gave you a lot of <n>gigantic</n> <n>tentacles</n>! Mom and I were kinda fighting for it tho there were plenty. They were so delicious!Her <p>spaghetti</p> came in <p>red sauce</p> with shrimps and <p>scallops</p> and other seafood. The shrimps were <n>huge</n> as well and mom was just enjoying her lunch so much. It was a really <n>big</n> portion and she barely made a dent. She'd be eating that for <n>dinner</n>, <n>lunch</n>, and another dinner.My meatball sandwich was a good size too and they filled the bread with three meatballs. I ate one and half meatballs and was done. The meatballs have great taste but it was too <n>salty</n> for me. The bread also got too <n>soggy</n> to be able to be picked up.Service was great and <n>attentive</n>. A couple of complaints, they kept refilling my <p>ice tea</p> by pitcher, and it was just pure <p>tea</p> and no <p>ice</p>. By the third cup, I had no ice either in my glass. Then, it was just tea, not <p>iced tea</p>. The second one was we had <n>lunch</n> rather early and the whole place was open. They placed a guy to sit by us though there were so many other open spaces. The guy sat so close to us on that <n>tiny</n> nook. It was fun before for me and mom to be able to talk freely and now we had one guy just sitting by us. Lol. No offense, guy. However, a little privacy was preferred. However, overall it was very pleasant and good lunch. Mom enjoyed it and that was all that mattered.",La Sorella di Francesca
