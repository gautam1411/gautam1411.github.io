3.9,"The menu is very small, as is the restaurant itself. I think we counted 32 total seats! I know they didn't used to take reservations, but they have since changed that which is nice - especially now that I've seen how small the space is. We didn't try one thing that I didn't like. Menu standouts were: <p>garlic fries</p>, <p>octopus appetizer</p>, <p>halibut</p>, and <p>veal</p>. They also had an <p>oyster appetizer</p> that was really unique - 3 <p>oysters</p> each prepared a different way. The third was smoked with <p>applewood chips</p> and had a cover on it, so when you opened it up, the <n>smoke</n> billowed out. Delicious! Another plus is that it's a BYOB, with a $5 <n>corkage</n> fee for the whole table. Not bad at all. Finally, the <n>bathroom</n> was so cool! It had a <n>darkroom door</n> leading into it, and the wall was lined with <n>old</n> <n>concert promo posters</n>.,",Ruxbin,Chicago
