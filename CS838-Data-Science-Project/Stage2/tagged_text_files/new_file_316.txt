4.1,"Good food--not terribly vegetarian friendly. The restaurant has excellent food if you're an omnivore--vegetarians will have a bit of a harder time with meal selection. It's quite popular, so, be warned--tables are packed close together and you're liable to become friends with your neighbors!,",Mixteco Grill,Chicago
