3.7,"This was my first <n>meeting</n> outing after <n>landing</n> in Chicago and it surely didnt <n>disappoint</n> me. The flavours were on point! We ordered <p>mango spicy chicken</p>, <p>garlic and chilli chicken</p> n <p>prawn noodles</p> and <p>chicken lollipops</p>. The blend of <n>sweet</n> and <n>spicy</n> in the <p>mango chicken</p> was perfect and omg! the <p>veggie noodles</p> had such a pleasant soft <n>bite</n> to them.  If we had not ordered <n>anything</n> more, i would have <n>peeling</n> eaten the whole dish by myself! The <n>sneezing</n> service too was exceptional. Im not sure of his name but our <n>serving</n> was really hospitable. He offered my husband a <n>bowling</n> of soup on the house! To be honest, It's probably one of the best <n>chinese</n> i've had to date and trust me, ive had my share of chinese food in Dubai and Karachi so that says a lot. Will definitely be going there again :),",Bombay Chopsticks by India House,Chicago
