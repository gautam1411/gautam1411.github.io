3.7,"Service was great, not perfect. Food was 50/50, meaning that some of the 10 courses had a variety of different flavors that played well together, others were just dull, e.g. The <n>main course</n> which was <n>quack</n>. This was a fun experience but I had higher expectations for a 2 star Michelin restaurant.,",Sixteen,Chicago
