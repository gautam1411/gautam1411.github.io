3.7,"A smattering pricey for the portion sizes – from the wine pours to entrées - but we would certainly try them again, especially since they’re in our neighborhood (…but only after they fix the air conditioning.) We started off with cocktails, including the <p>Armeni-tini</p> ($11) a light and <n>refreshing</n> <p>pomegranate</p> and <p>vodka martini</p>, and the <p>Chili-Dilly</p> ($10), a tart and <n>mildly spicy</p> <p>chile vodka concoction</p>, served up with a huge sprig of <p>dill</p>. Certainly <p>craft drinks</p> worthy of the price.We started with the <p>Mezza Sampler</p>, which was delivered mere seconds after ordering. The long, three-sectioned plate featured labneh – a “<p>farmer’s cheese dip</p>”- which tasted like <n>plain</n> <p>cream cheese</p> with a <p>fruity olive oil drizzle</p> and a light dusting of <p>paprika</p>. There were two <n>ice-cold</n>, but <n>flavorful</n>, <p>yalanchi sarma</p> - <p>grape leaves</p> <n>stuffed</n> with <p>raisins</p>, <p>almonds</p> and <p>chopped herbs</p>. The trio was rounded out with a decent portion of <p>baba ghannouj</p>, the <n>famously</n> <n>roasted</n> <p>eggplant dip</p>, all served with a basket of <p>rocket-hot</p> <p>pita bread</p>. For $10.95, the offering was a decent way for two people to sample some of their traditional fare.The dining space itself is long and very (very) dark, with several small, semicircular cubby-holes that easily seat two, maybe three, with a third chair. On a recent Saturday night, the back of the room had been set up for a table of 20 when we arrive, but during our 90 minute meal, there were only about a dozen people in the restaurant. There were a few dining tables outside, and the bar can easily seat six to eight people. The bathrooms are down a steep flight of stairs, and were absolutely spotless. One thing we noticed half way through our dining was the temperature in the restaurant was rising rather quickly – despite being directly under an airduct, we could feel no air flowing. Some of the guests around us pointed out the room’s temperature to their waiters, and it sounded like the restaurant was having some problems with their air conditioning.  Feeling the heat, we opted for a glass of the <p>Armenian wine</p> ($9), a fresh and <n>fruity</n> pomegranate-based red, and a glass of one of their summer special <p>white wine</p>, a Pierre et Papa ($9) – sadly, the pours in the small <p>goblets</p> were rather miserly for the money.Much like the appetizers, our entrees arrived very quickly after ordering – the <p>shish kabobs</p> ($20.95) featured perfectly seared cubes of herbaceous lamb, cooked to exactly medium rare and sporting a nice, evenly charred crust. The flavors were spot-on, but the bed of white rice underneath was utterly flavorless. Our second entree, the Armenian Combo –was billed as “a generous serving of <p>sarma</p>, <p>boereg</p>, <p>kufta</p> and eggplant”, but was woefully lacking in generosity at $17.95. The three piece sarma (<p>stuffed grape leaves</p>) were stuffed with <p>minced meat</p> and spices, unfortunately they were covered in a rather tasteless, <n>cheese-like</n> sauce we couldn’t identify. The kufta, a lone, golf ball-sized meatball, was nicely flavored with spices and came swimming in a lemony cream sauce. The boereg was the only real stand out – a perfectly crispy filo-wrapped portion of spinach and cheese. The roasted eggplant was nothing more than a non-pureed version of their baba ghannouj. By now, it was rather stifling inside the restaurant due to the lack of airflow, so instead of ordering desserts and coffee, we opted for our check – just over $104.00, before tip.,",Sayat-Nova,All Reviews 20
