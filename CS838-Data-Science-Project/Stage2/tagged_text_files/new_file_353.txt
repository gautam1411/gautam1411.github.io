3.7,Great way to start the morning. I visited Orange during Lollapalooza and was very happy with my breakfast. They had a special Lollapalooza flight of pancakes," edition for the weekend which was themed off of different music artists songs and was absolutely delicious. The orange coffee was tasty, the restaurants layout was open that brought in a lot of sunshine and the service was terrific. I would definitely go back when I'm in Chicago.",Orange
