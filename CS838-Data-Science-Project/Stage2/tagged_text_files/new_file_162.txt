3.9,"Really great sushi but pricing should be listed as $$$. You only get one piece of <p>nigiri</p>/sashimi per order, so we ended up having to order several items to share at our table of 3. Throw in 3 <p>Sapporos</p> and a small bottle of <p>hot house sake</p>, and our bill was nearly $200!,",Arami,Chicago
