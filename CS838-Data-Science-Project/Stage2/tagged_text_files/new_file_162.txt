3.7,"I have been here a handful of times and have had a mixed bag when it comes to the quality of food. I will say that the service has always been impeccable. Most meals have been very tasty but I have made  a couple choices in dish that I would like back. The <p>chicken parm</p> is a really good go to. I could see easily making this an expensive meal but it is not at all a must. You can absolutely get by with a hearty inexpensive meal.,",Chicago Prime Italian,Chicago
