3.0,"This family owned restaurant, located in a strip mall along Route 59,  offers a variety of Indian and Pakistani fare. Although there are a number of tables, most of their business seems to be carry out. Most of the food is already prepared, although the <p>naan</p> and <p>roti</p> are prepared upon order. Both <p>vegetarian</p> and <p>non-vegetarian</p> entrees are available. Food and service are good, and the prices are decent.,",Tandoor Hut,Chicago
