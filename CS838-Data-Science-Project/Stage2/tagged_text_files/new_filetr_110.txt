3.8,"Mexican food lover. I purchased a <p>chicken burrito</p> meal to go. Right off the bat, i thought it was <n>pricey</n> ($13.95). The rice and beans portions were small. They only filled half the compartment of the take out tray. The burrito was bland. It had no seasoning, no flavor, very little taste. There was no lettuce and very little tomatoes. I cannot recommend this dinner and will not go there again. Bottomline - overpriced and blah food.The restaurant would be a wonderful place for a date. It's very dark and cozy. So i would suggest going there for a date, have a few <p>chilled margueritas</p>, don't buy the food.For good mexican food, try blue Agave on w maple st, chicago.,",La Cantina Grill,Chicago
