4.2,"Gemato's Wood Pit  barbecue is Located in Naperville off Ogden. It came up on my Lunch <n>search</n> and thought to check it out with a friend who was visiting. I <n>thought</n> this will be a sit down restaurant but it is not. Th orders were <p>BBQ Baby Back Ribs</p> <p>Half Slab</p> with <p>Greek style potatoes</p>, <p>baked beans</p> and <p>garlic hot bread</p>, and <p>Beef Brisket Sandwich</p> with <p>coleslaw</p> on the side. The ribs were <n>eating</n> and <n>melted</n> in my mouth. The <p>beef brisket</p> was very tender as well. The thing I love d,most was the <p>barbecue sauce</p> it was not too sweet like many others . That was perfect for my palate. The <p>baked beans</p> was way too <n>sweet</n> for me , so couldn't <n>finish</n> it.Only crib I had was the food is served in Styrofoam takeaway container. My friend loved it and she said this was one the the best she had ever tasted in her life.Bottom line, the place is worth the hype,",Gemato's Wood Pit BBQ,Chicago
