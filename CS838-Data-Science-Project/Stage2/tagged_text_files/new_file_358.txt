3.8,"I used to be a regular when I lived in the area. Now my visits are less often. This place makes the best burgers anywhere. My favorite is the Parmesan burger. <n>Flame broiled</n>. They put a huge pat of <p>garlic butter</p> on the burger and top with the cheese and melt it. Meat is fresh. Chili is the best! It's topped with onions, jalape��os and cheese and the crock is put direct on the grill to melt it. Eat at the bar for the cooking show and the fast hot service. Really the best I've had!,",The Assembly,Chicago
