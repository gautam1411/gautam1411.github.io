3.7,"<n>Yummy</n> pre-movie dinner. We decided to try The Peasantry before going to see a movie at the Landmark Century. We had an early family dinner and arrived when there was only one other table seated. The service was great and the staff very knowledgeable about the menu. We tried <p>mussels</p>, a salad, some entrees and sandwiches. All was very good with interesting flavors. I liked that portions were plenty but not enormous. Specials that stood out included an arugula salad with a blood orange dressing, a rabbit sandwich and a duck BLT with fried green tomatoes. The vegetarian plate was a good option for a lighter entree. <n>Prices</n> are reasonable for the quality. We'll definitely return!,",The Peasantry,Chicago
