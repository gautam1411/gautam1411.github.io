4.1,"<n>Delicious</n> blend of <n>polish</n> and Italian cuisine. <p>american cheese Pizza</p> is always good, <p>perogi</p> is on point, and definitely try the <p>pork wings</p>. Bartenders and front house staff are the best. The back bar and patio workers seem to always have an attitude. I usually try to sit in the main dining area. Been coming here for years, one of the better south loop spots for beer and pizza. Great place for <p>Bulls beers</p> and Blackhawks games.                                                 chicagofoodgame.com,",Flo & Santos,Chicago
