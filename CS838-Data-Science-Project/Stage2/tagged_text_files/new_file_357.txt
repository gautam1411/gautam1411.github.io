4,"What a find!. In town visiting my daughter. Stopped a random local couple walking by and they sent us there. Urban contemporary interior. Very welcoming. Great service. A <n>server</n> kept filling my Sapporo without me even seeing her. Sushi Chefs are highly skilled and entertaining as well. More than happy to offer suggestions and explanations for the novice. Some of the best Sushi anywhere in my travels. You can't go wrong here.,",Sai Cafe,Chicago
