3.7,"Excellent food. Went here with my family on a recent Chicago trip as it was just around the corner from our hotel. The chicken kids meal was HUGE and all of us loved it. My wife had the wings and I had the <p>Corn Beef Hash Reuben</p>, which was excellent as well. It is not a sandwich, but a mixture of hash browns, corn beef, <p>sauerkraut</p> and I topped them off with scrambled eggs. Server was super friendly and made the experience even better. You should go!,",Kerryman,Chicago
