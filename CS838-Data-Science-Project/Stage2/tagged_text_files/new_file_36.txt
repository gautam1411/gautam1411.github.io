3.9,"It definitely has warm and cozy atmosphere. The <p>port wine</p> selections were extensive and good.  The appetizer I got I think was a special and it did not bode well with me... I wished I had gotten some of the other options I saw coming out.  However, I did have the <p>baked duck meat</p> and it was fantastic!Â I recommend this place for a <n>fun</n> date or night with the ladies.  Smaller <n>groups</n> are definitely better because its very cramped and very FRENCH!                                                northandred.com,",Kiki's Bistro,Chicago
