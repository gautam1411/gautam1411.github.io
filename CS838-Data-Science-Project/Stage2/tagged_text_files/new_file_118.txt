3.7,"Absolutely lovely restaurant with elegant, minimalist interiors. It certainly has a black and white art deco vibe. Some very lovely views from the windows, but a window seat can't be promised. A small, very intimate restaurant...perfect for a romantic date (not a first date) or a proposal.Â Food is beautifully presented and cooked to perfection. Each course better than the last. I was so impressed by the rose essence mini macarons. Wonderful wine and champagne selection. Service is great but not outstanding, as servers lack warmth though they make up for it with knowledge of the cuisine.Dress code: VERY very smart. Men should wear suits and ladies should wear a nice, conservative dress. Just shy of evening black tie.",Everest,Chicago
