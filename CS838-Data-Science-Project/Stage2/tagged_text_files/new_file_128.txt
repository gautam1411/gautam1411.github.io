4.0,"I was here on Tuesday morning with a colleague.  It is an <n>excellent</n> breakfast spot and I've been here a couple of times before.The restaurant is open and bright with big picture windows <n>facing</n> the street.  On all of my visits the staff has been courteous and helpful and service from the kitchen has been quick.The food is <n>excellent</n> - great <p>cheese omelettes</p> and <p>baked crepes</p>, <p>fresh juices</p> and smoothies.  The <p>hot black coffee</p> is also well above average.  Even the <p>jam cheese toast</p>s and <p>sweet butter</p> for your <p>toasted bread</p> is great.It is a little pricey - about $50 for two for breakfast - but the quality of both food and service make it feel like a reasonable value.  I'll be back here the next time I'm in town.,",Meli Cafe,Chicago
