3.8,"Can I give it zero stars? Decent food, terrible service the last two times I was in.. We went in this past Saturday and sat in the back area. Someone greeted us and gave us brunch menus. It was close to 3 PM. No one else acknowledged our presence for 15 minutes despite me desperately trying to make eye contact with anyone. I was hungry and we knew what we wanted. They were not terribly busy. Two waitresses appeared to be finished with a large group who seemed to be dining on a buffet set up just for their group. When the waitress (short blond hair) finally arrived to take our order, she said it was after three and we couldn't order brunch. Why were we given brunch menus, I wondered. I told her if they were more prompt in taking our order we would have gotten in under the time limit. Then she argued with me about when she arrived!  I couldn't believe it. Where in the customer service training manual does it say argue with your customers","? WTF!!! I told the bartender why we were leaving. He made a half-hearted (at best) attempt to make it right.We will not return. There are plenty of places to eat in Rogers Park.Forgot to add, we've ordered delivery a few times. Always slow, soggy, and incorrect orders.",Fireside Restaurant & Lounge
