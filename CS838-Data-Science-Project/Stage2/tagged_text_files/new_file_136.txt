3.9,"Hash House is a great place to go to get a belly FULL of good food! I first visited in Vegas a few years ago. We stopped in the Chicago location for a quick breakfast. Come hungry or plan to share because the portions are huge! All fresh creations and good service make Hash House a great place.,",Hash House a Go Go,Chicago
