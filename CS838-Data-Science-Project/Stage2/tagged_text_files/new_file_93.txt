4.0,"Went here with a few friends. Great restaurant and kid friendly. The service is good and so are the tapas. Nothing I would rave about but still good enough to maybe go back. Even though it's a tapas restaurant the portions seemed a little small to me in comparison to other tapas restaurants. Overall I had a good time. There was nothing to complain about but also nothing to rave about either.,",La Tasca Restaurant,Chicago
