4.1,Waste of time and gas!. The worst experience ever!!!! do not go! i do not use valet but do have a handicapped placard. of course no spots so i drove around found a spot on side and a valet drove at me with lights into my car said if you park her you won't have a car," i double checked no signs for valet parking there but i fearfully pulled out. called the manager on duty who defended him! really? who goes out for a nice evening to be bullied? i drove across to the other lot, too far for me to walk to call the friends i was meeting to say i can't come. - again headlights and dirty looks - prob fingers too -i chose not to make eye contact. i have emailed the corporate office and received no response - big surprise. this place is the worst in an area where there are awesome restaurants.... skip the dining from hell and go elsewhere!",Cooper's Hawk Winery & Restaurant
