4.3,"Possibly my favorite place in the world. Grew up eating <p>pizza</p> here and in my 47 years on earth I've never had <n>better</n> pizza. The place looks exactly the same as i remember it and that only adds to the experience. From the Tinkle lights over the bar, the dirty cracked tile floor, the guys tossing the paddle back and forth in the kitchen, to the black oven dust on your perfectly juicy yet crispy squares of heaven...I adore everything about this place. See you Thursday!,",Vito & Nick's Pizzeria,Chicago
