3.6,"Pizza, <p>breadsticks</p>, mozzarella sticks and a 2 liter.Not only were the breadsticks <n>overcooked</n> to the point of being hard tack, but the pizza was <n>UNDERCOOKED</n>.  (And being chicago style- not good we could notice that).Mozzarella sticks were undercooked, <n>limp</n> and <n>soggy</n>. but they were clearly store bought anyway, so whatever.But the crowning achievement was that they gave us a 2 <n>liter</n> of <p>mountain  dew</p> that was 3 MONTHS OUT OF DATE!!  and considering they last for more than 6 from production, I wonder how fresh the actual ingredients they use in the kitchen.2/10 - delivery guy didn't even know if we PAID or NOT when he delivered.Either get your shit together and pay attention to what you're giving to your customers, or go work for <n>domino's</n>.,",Aliano's Ristorante,Chicago
