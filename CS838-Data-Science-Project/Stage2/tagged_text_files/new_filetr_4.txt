3.7,"If you want the feeling of being dropped down in the middle of Krak√≥w in the middle of a Saturday lunch time, stop in. If <n>Polish</n> people in the area support it, you know it must be good! Wonderful <p>deli meat</p> counter along with <n>scrumptious</n> prepared foods that can feed one for lunch or twenty. Try their <p> chocolate brownie</p> and  <p>pineapple pastries</p> as well. And don't forget the <p>Polish beers</p>, <p>french wine</p> if you're adventurous. Some are pretty good, if you're a beer drinker. Love this place and I'm glad it's in LZ!!,",Ania's Polish Deli,Chicago
