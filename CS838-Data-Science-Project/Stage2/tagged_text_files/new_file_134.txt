4.0,"I was here on Tuesday morning with a colleague.  It is an excellent breakfast spot and I've been here a couple of times before.The restaurant is open and bright with big picture windows facing the street.  On all of my visits the staff has been courteous and helpful and service from the kitchen has been quick.The food is <n>excellent</n> - great omelettes and <p>crepes</p>, fresh juices and smoothies.  The coffee is also well above average.  Even the <p>jam</p>s and <p>sweet butter</p> for your <p>toast</p> is great.It is a little pricey - about $50 for two for breakfast - but the quality of both food and service make it feel like a reasonable value.  I'll be back here the next time I'm in town.,",Meli Cafe,Chicago
