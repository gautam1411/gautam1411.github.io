3.6,"We've been going there for years and years, even before they moved to their current location. While their fare has changed over the years from the true tapas/small portions to more of real dinner portions, it's a solid place and the service is always good. Plenty of wine on hand and if you don't see what you like, Matt will get it for you!  Definitely a staple in our group of friends!,",Bacchus Nibbles,All Reviewsï¿½_7
