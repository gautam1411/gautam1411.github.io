4.4,"I stopped in after hearing all the hype about their <n>baked</n> goods, and I'd have to say it overall good!  The prices were reasonable and the selection wasn't too bad, even for an afternoon.  I was able to try some of their <p>butter cookies</p>, which were absolutely delicious.  The ones dipped in chocolate with <p>nuts</p> was my favorite.  It was crisp and <n>light</n>, the cookie just <n>buttery</n> enough.  I think I'd come back to pick up some sweets around Christmas time!,",Swedish Bakery,Chicago
