3.8,"Hands down the BEST <p>Italian Beef sandwich</p> I’ve had since arriving in Chicago two years ago. The amazingly tender <p>meat</p> arrives lovingly cradled in a super-soft, <p>foot-long roll</p> that holds the entire package snugly together.  Ask for yours “wet”, and they’ll dunk the entire <p>sandwich</p> in the au jus before wrapping it up in classic wax paper. If you’re feeling adventurous, order the “Combo” and they’ll lay a perfectly–charred, spicy(!) sausage across the length of your sandwich – but plan on a nap afterwards!Other offerings include a <p>meatball sandwich</p>, a “cuppa tree” different cold subs, a wide selection of <p>Italian-style pizzas</p> (pan and thin, whole and by-the-slice) and made-to-order calzones. Also available are classic Chicago-style <p>Vienna hotdogs</p>, <p>cheeseburgers</p> and fried sides ranging from <p>fries</p> to <p>cheese</p>.Arrive early – things get busy starting at 11:30am on the weekdays. And the place suffers from a bit of dis’feng shui, with two and three lines of folks snaking up to the stage-like platform where you place your order.  Grab your cafeteria tray of <n>goodness</n> and head back down the stairs to the dining room – then secure your hunched-over, elbows up position to safely enjoy your soaking wet Italian beef sandwich.,",Luke's Italian Beef,Chicago
