3.9,"<n>Wonderful</n>. I love <p>pizza napoletana</p>. I love the <n>chewy</n> crust and crispy edges. Frankie's makes great pizza. Unfortunately I have no idea why I ordered the type of pizza I did - I HATE truffles, therefore I hate <p>truffle oil</p>. So of course I ordered a pizza with truffle oil. Duh! That being said, Frankie's was able to take an ingredient I despise and make it <n>tolerable</n>. That's magic. One complaint - I ordered the <p>arugula salad</p> which is served with olive oil and lemon. That being said they needed to use the sale shaker a bit - or at least put one on the table. The Granda Padano didn't offer enough salt for what was a huge salad. Service was ok - he just seemed to realize his time was best spent with tables of more than one person. I guess I don't blame him. Overall <n>pretty</n> good.,",Frankie's Pizzeria & Scaloppine,Chicago
