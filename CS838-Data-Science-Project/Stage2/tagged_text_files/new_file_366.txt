3.6,"Full disclosure, my wife and I came in using the $120 Groupon for the tasting menu on 8/9.  When I saw that I had to snap it up.  We don't usually splurge on high end fine dining but thought this would be a great opportunity to test the waters.  Upon stepping in the door the service is phenomenal.  You're led to your <n>table</n> and you can see there's a brigade of servers floating around making sure your <p>water</p> is never less than half full and meticulously placing new silverware with each course.  Once you're settled the service starts and it is definitely an <n>experience</n>. The tasting menu had about 10 <n>courses</n> overall.  Each one was presented in a unique way.  If you're looking for big portions you may be disappointed but to be honest I was satisfied by the end.  I could describe everything but I'm sure the menu changes fairly often so here were the highlights. - Fried oyster <n>coated</n> in granola was something I didn't even know was a thing.  Plus they served it in the shells but those shells were placed in this planter filled with sticks and pebbles.  -The salmon was the most delicate piece of fish I've ever had. I don't even enjoy fish and it was cooked just rare so that it was flaky and amazing.  - <p>Clam chowder</p> that was prepared at the table. The soup was extremely delicate and my wife commented that this was one of the first times she really saw me trying to get every bit of soup onto my spoon.  I could go on but I will say they put a lot of effort into the presentation of each course.  The ascetic of modern fused with nature definitely comes through. You could even tell that the bowls and other serving ware were chosen because it seemed like they were molded with a woodsy pattern.  I'd give acadia a 4.5.euroatheart.com,",Acadia,Chicago
