4.1,"I haven't been back to this place since 2010. I ordered the food for delivery and they showed up 2 hours later and with the wrong order. At 930 on a weekday with 2 little ones I was upset called to complain and was hung up on. Then when I asked for a refund the kitchen manager said, yeah that's gonna happen. He ultimately did credit my card a few days later, but to make things worse he sent the delivery driver here to pick up the uneaten food. I've spent years warning people against this place. Who cares about the food when the service and management treat customers like that? Stay far away from this place!,",Palermo's 95th,Chicago
