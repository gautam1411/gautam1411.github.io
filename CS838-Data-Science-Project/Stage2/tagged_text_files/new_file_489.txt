4.1,"I went to stacked with my family.  It was about 7 of us.  The wait was about 35 min which apparently is pretty typical.  The waitress we had was very knowledgeable and attentive.  I ordered the <p>brocolli and cheese omelette</p> and added <p>grilled chicken</p>.  It came with <p>potatoes</p> and a small stack of <p>pancakes</p>.  The <p>omelette</p> was a bit <n>dry</n> as it was slightly overdone.  The <n>taste</n> however was very good.  I thought they could have used more <p>cheddar cheese</p>.  It appeared they only put a slice on <n>top</n> which I was inadequate.  The pancakes were just ok.  They didn't have the fluffiness you would expect in a pancake.  In fact, they really just soaked up syrup.My girlfriend had the <p>eggs Benedict</p>.  She said the <p>ham</p> and the <p>English muffin</p> was good but the <p>sauce</p> wasn't very tasty.  Everyone else had <p>skillets</p>"," which they <n>raved</n> over.  They certainly were big so there was a lot of left overs for them.  I thought the service was better than the food.  Although it's a good place, considering Oak Lawn isn't known for great culinary institutes, I don't think it's worth the wait.  If you can get in in under 10-15 min try it out.  If not, check out a second option.",Stacked
