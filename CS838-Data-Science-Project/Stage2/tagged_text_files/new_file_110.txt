3.7,"Here is an Indian's perspective on this excellent meat house. Their Fillet Mignon with Garlic Mashed Potato is an excellent Medium-Rare cooked steak. Has a great taste and the tenderness of the meat is perfect. I personally do not recommend a tender steak with BBQ Sauce as the latter tends to overpower all other flavours. Visited with colleagues/friends in Sep and we decided to sit out as it was a sunny-bright day. Overall an excellent lunch time. A must try if you are fond of good meat!,",Weber Grill Restaurant,Chicago
