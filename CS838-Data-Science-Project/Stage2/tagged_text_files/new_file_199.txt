4.4,"I feel so lucky (and maybe unlucky?) that Buona Terra is right around the corner from me on California. This family-owned restaurant is intimate, yet lively. I first went with my roommate's family, then with my own... and saw another friend there with her parents. So yeah, it's definitely a crowd-pleaser.First, you get free bread with this delicious <p>garlic spread</p>...already worth the price of admission, I know. Then, you should either order the Carpaccio de Barbabietola (<p>beet salad</p> with <p>fried goat cheese</p>) or the Panzanella Toscana, which is a super light and fresh tomato/cucumber/olive salad.For your main, you can't go wrong with anything, really, but I'd stay away from the daily specials and go straight for the Rigatoni Buona Terra (especially if you're a big goat cheese fan - see a theme, here?). My other favorites are the Ravioli con Vitello and the Gnocchi Verde al Quattro Formaggi. The staff is super friendly and attentive, and I love their wine list.My only suggestion would be unlimited pasta for neighbors. ;) If Zomato had emojis, I would give two thumbs up!,",Buona Terra,Chicago
