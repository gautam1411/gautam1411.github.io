4.3,"This is the cutest <n>Thai place</n> ever. Their <n>decorate</n> is so <n>charming</n> filled with <n>cute</n> <n>knick knacks</n>. That's not it. The food one ups the decor. It's my go-to places for <n>Thai</n>. I am a big fan of their <n>lunch specials</n>. It's such a great price for such good food. My all time here are the <p>pad kee mao</p>, <p>green curry with tofu</p> and the <p>curried fried rice</p>, <p> Egg masala </p>. I highly recommend these dishes. Every time I go I end up ordering them so that I don't have to choose.,",Cozy Noodles & Rice,Chicago
