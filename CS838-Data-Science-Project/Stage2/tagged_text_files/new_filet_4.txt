2.9,"I'm pretty <n>conflicted</n> right now about this review. The food was really very good. I ordered the wings as an appetizer and the <p>chicken sandwich</p> as an entree. The wings were slightly spicy and very <n>meaty</n> which filled my stomach with joy and chicken. The sandwich itself was good but <n>paled</n> in comparison taste wise to the wings. The service was pretty bad, in terms of water refills it was fine, but when it came to anything more complicated the man came of snooty and <n>uncaring</n>.,",Reverie,Chicago
