3.7,"My friend and I originally had a lunch-time reservation, but upon closer inspection we realized the lunch menu did not have all of the yummy things we wanted to try, so we switched our reso to dinner.  First let me say, the <p>beef cheek pierogis</p> were <n>outstanding</n>.  Seriously, I wanted about ten more of those.  We also ordered the <p>schnitzel</p> and the <p>chicken paprikash</p>.  I wasn't overly impressed with either.  The service was good, the atmosphere was nice, so I'd be willing to give it another go for food.,",Bohemian House,Chicago
