3.7,"Came here for dinner and had an amazing time. We were a pretty big party and they seated us even though half our party wasn't there yet. Love the modern take on an Italian restaurant which creates a modern feel but still has touched that obviously show this is an Italian restaurant. Very fun <n>upbeat</n> atmosphere and not at all pretentious. The various options of unique <p>potato bruschettas></p> was amazing! Had the <p>spicy salami</p> and <p>ricotta bruschetta</p> and I was very impressed! <n>Light</n> and <n>delicious</n>. The <p>penne pasta</p> were delicious without being <n>heavy</n>. The <p>corn carbonara</p> did not have <p>cheese mushroom</p> and <p>baked peas</p> unlike all other <p>corn carbonaras</p> I've had, however, it was definitely delicious, not extremely <n>creamy</n> or <n>salty</n>, light and <n>fresh</n>. Everything we had was light, fresh, and over all delicious. It is the type of place where you can overeat without falling into a food coma. Service was attentive without bring <n>over-bearing</n>. Overall had a great time.,",Tre Soldi,Chicago
