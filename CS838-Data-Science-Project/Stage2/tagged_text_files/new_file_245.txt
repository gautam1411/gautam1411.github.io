3.9,"I absolutely love the service here. They really went above and beyond. Brunch was fantastic and the cost was damn good. We had the Fried Chicken Benedict, which was good, but it needed a little bit more flavor. They were generous with the Mimosas. Love this place.,",Dunlays on the Square,All Reviewsï¿½_16
