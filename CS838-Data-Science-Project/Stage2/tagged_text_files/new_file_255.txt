3.6,"Loved the food, the drink, the atmosphere, and the pig murals. After much deliberation, I decided on the pulled pork nachos and they we're fantastic. My husband got the <p>Western Texas burger</p> and loved it. We bother paired our meals with the Hell or <p>High Watermelon wheat beer</p>. To top it off, we downed a delicious warm chocolate cookie topped with <p>vanilla ice cream</p> and chocolate sauce. Amazing menu, solid beer selection, and a great place to hang out. We'll definitely go again when we're next in Chicago.,",Barn & Company,Chicago
