3.8,"utstanding, with Charm and Great Service!!!. Enjoying an early dinner with friends. Found this Gem on Groupon and was so glad I did. We had the 8 piece chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy and biscuits. Chicken was fried fresh and crisp. Not <n>overly</n> <n>seasoned</n>, but good and hot. Mashed potatoes and gravy were excellent and the biscuit, not so much. Started with the recommended Mac and Cheese as a starter. ABSOLUTELY <n>INCREDIBLE</n>!!!! Very cheesey with a strong layer of Cheddard melted across the top. Some of the best I've ever had in my life. Great Place. Service was <n>outstanding</n>, and I'm definitely going again, Groupon or not.,",Stanley's Kitchen and Tap,Chicago
