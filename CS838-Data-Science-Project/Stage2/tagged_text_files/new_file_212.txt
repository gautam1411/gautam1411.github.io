3.6,"Sullivan's is a favorite steakhouse of mine. They set themselves apart from all the other steakhouses by offering a jazz age feel of the 20s and 30s. They back this up by offering jazz in the bar on a nightly basis for free. Their happy hour specials are one of the best in all of Chicago on Thursday nights. They offer $7.00 drinks from a select menu of top shelf beverages and the same $7.00 food items that are very filling and quite delicious. They extend this happy hour special to service industry folks all day on Sundays. The nightly happy hour menu is slightly more, but relatively speaking, still a good deal. As far as their main menu, you get your traditional American steakhouse fare at Chicagoland prices. I still enjoy their atmosphere the most out of all of the steakhouses though.,",Sullivan's Steakhouse,Chicago
