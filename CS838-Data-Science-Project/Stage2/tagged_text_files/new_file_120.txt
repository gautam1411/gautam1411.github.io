3.9,"Decent <n>Italian</n> fare. The restaurant layout is very cool. I've had great food and service at Gioco before, but I've also had subpar food and service too. It's a bit overpriced for what I consider to be average Italian food, but if you're in the south loop and must have Italian, it's not a bad choice.                                                 chicagofoodgame.com,",Gioco,Chicago
