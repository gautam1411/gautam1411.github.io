3.6,"Went for <n>lunch</n> and overall a pretty good experience. Limited <n>menu</n> and <n>wine list</n>- that said selections were were well matched. <p>Scallops</p> with <p>black beans</p>, <p>salad</p> and <p>chocolate mousse</p> was prepared and presented very well. Matching <p>Rose wine</p> the recommendation was just right. <p>Quiche</p> just as good as the scallops. Restaurant wasn't busy during our visit - service was good, the owner took our order and was interested in hearing of our experience and asked us to stop in again. We will.,",Cafe Central,All ReviewsÂ 6
