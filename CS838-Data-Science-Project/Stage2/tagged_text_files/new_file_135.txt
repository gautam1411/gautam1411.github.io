3.8,"First off, I love the decor of this place. We sat upstairs tucked in a back corner and the energy was vibrant! I couldn't pick a cocktail from the extensive list, so I told my server I liked <p>whiskey</p>, <p>tequila</p>, and <p>mezcal</p> as my drink-bases. They made me a drink that was outstanding. We had the burrata appetizer which was highly recommended from other reviewers, and it did not disappoint. The portions were very generous and we had plenty left over. We split two pastas: hen egg, sage, and brown butter and the crab, sea urchin, and chili taglioni. Both were outstanding. Would order both again in a heartbeat. Pricey but not outrageous!,",Balena,Chicago
