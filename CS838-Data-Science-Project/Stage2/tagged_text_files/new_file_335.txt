4,"Solid breakfast offerings with many variations on each theme-- Egg Skillets, Pancakes, French Toast, Omelets, etc. A couple standouts for us were the <p>Ghirardelli Chocolate Chip Pancakes</p>, the <p>Hash Browns</p> and the Hot Chocolate with mointainous helping of whipped cream. <p>Eggs Benedict</p> were just meh, with a <p>Hollandaise</p> that had little to it. Corned Beef Hash tasted like it was out of a can. An ok place if you find an dish or two you favor and return for specifically, but I probably would not be a regular.,",Burnt Toast,Chicago
