3.9,"<p>Ahi tuna</p> was not fresh, the <p>potato filet</p> was very dry and definately not <n>tender </n>(med rare), and the <p>seabass</p> was overcooked. Service was good however. There are just so many other options which are better! Overall this is an overpriced, mediocre establishment that used <n>brown</n> construction paper for a tablecloth.,",Bonefish Grill,Chicago
