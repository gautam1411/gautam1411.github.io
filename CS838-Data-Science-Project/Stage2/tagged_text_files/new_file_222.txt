4.1,"I knew of this place for a while, but had never been to it.  My friends forced me to go one day, and against my will, I went along.Wow.  This was life changing...as far as food is concerned.I have been more than 30 times since and always took family and friends when they came to visit.  They also loved it.The meat is of a good quality, and the pitas come out hot and feel like they are made fresh in the restaurant.  I am not sure of the actual name, but the spicy sauce they have is by far the best I have ever had at a restaurant with this style of food.We moved from Chicago to Kansas City 3 yeas ago, and I really miss this place.  Have yet to find a place down here that can compete, despite trying several.  Every time I am in Chicago, I have to eat here at least once, and would highly recommend trying it out.,",Pita Inn,Chicago
