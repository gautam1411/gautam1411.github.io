3.8,"<n>Amazing</n> burgers!!! My husband and I got the number one and number 5 burgers and shared them. Each ingredient in the burgers had an amazing flavor, but it all worked great together to make a really different and amazing taste. The number 5 was so different from any burger I had ever had...it was a lamb burger with <p>tzatziki  sauce</p>, <p>feta</p>, roasted tomatoes, and onions. It was hard to decide which one was my favorite!!! For dessert, we had a <p>caramel boozy shake</p>. It was so delicious! Service was great, super friendly! Definitely would come back here again!,",25 Degrees,Chicago
