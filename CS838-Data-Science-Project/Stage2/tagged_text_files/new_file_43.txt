4.1,"Don't Bother. Food okay But service not good at all. Below par for a <p>Lettuce</p> Entertain You eatery. Ordered <p>ice tea</p> and it took 15 minutes to get sugar. Since when isn' t there sugar on the table?? She said she didn't know that I wanted <p>sugar</p> because I had been in the bathroom. Main orders had sides mixed up, and waitress never came by to ask if everything was ok during the meal. On her behalf she did fill my tea. Never going back to spend my hard earned money there.
