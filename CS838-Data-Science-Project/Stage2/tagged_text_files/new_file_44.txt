3.7,"This is a gem in the realm of a lot of good restaurants and bars in the Milwaukee West Loop area.  I like the style and look of this place. The food was very good and cocktails were spot on. Very vibrant scene.  Favorite food we had was <p>fresh spring peas</p> with <p>bacon</p> and <p>whipped Yukon gold potatoes<p> with a <p>black truffle sauce<p> / gravy.  WOW!,",Nellcôte,Chicago
