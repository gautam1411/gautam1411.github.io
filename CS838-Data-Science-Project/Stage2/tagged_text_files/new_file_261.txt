3.8,"Love the Quad-City style! The <n>crust</n> is not too thick,  not too thin and the sauce is so <n>flavorful</n> with just a little kick. You can try something crazy like the <p>Taco Pizza</p>, but I'd suggest just building your own (can get pricey though! ). Also, the mozzarella sticks are amazeballs. Nice ambiance with great big booths and big beet selection!                                                 instagram.com,",Roots Handmade Pizza,Chicago
