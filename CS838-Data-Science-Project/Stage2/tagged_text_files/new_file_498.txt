3.6,"Chicago has <n>great</n> <p>pizza</p> and when people tell you about pizza it's always deep dish - but we really have more than that. While I love deep dish and there are a few other thin crust places that I like slightly more -- when I want just a <n>slice</n> or two....or have some fun toppings this is the place to go! Also, if you're looking for a deal get their PB&J - Pizza, <p>Blue Ribbon</p> and <p>Jameson shot</p>! Speaking of Jameson---get the soft serve ice cream and if you are looking for something to up the game get the <p>donuts</p>! The best in the city...especially because you get ice cream to dip them in! Yums!,",The Boiler Room,Chicago
