3.8,"It's <n>terrible</n>.  We ordered penang curry and a <p>yellow curry</p>. The potatoes weren't cooked through in the yellow curry and the penang tasted like it was made with with peanut butter. I don't even thnk they used coconut cream as could not taste. Don't go to this place if you been to Thailand and know what a Thai curry should taste like.,",Dao Thai,Chicago
