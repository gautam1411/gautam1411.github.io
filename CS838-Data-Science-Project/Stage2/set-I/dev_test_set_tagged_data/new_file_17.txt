3.3,"arly Valentines Dinner for Two. My husband Jeff and I had decided awhile ago to check out John & Tony's. Since I am on call all from 0800 Saturday until 0800 Sunday we decided to celebrate Valentines on the 13th. What a welcome surprise we found! The interior was very attractive and <n>relaxing</n>. Our waiter and busboy were both perfectly attentive although we did not hear about any specials that might have been options. Calamari was delicious, especially if you opted the <p>garlic sauce</p> on the side. Chicken with Rice soup had a nice depth of flavor. Salad was simple but very good as well. May suggest croutons made fresh in-house? Our steaks were perfectly <n>aged</n>, tender and full of flavor. Sides of <p>boiled Asparagus</p> and <n>Sauted</n> Mushrooms with Garlic were a delicious addition to the beef and the roasted red potatoes. So full we <n>skipped</n> coffee and dessert this time, we will try and save room next visit. Overall an excellent dining experience all around. The ONLY suggestion I can offer is serrated knives for the steaks, chops etc..... We will certainly be back and will highly recommend you to friends and family looking for and exceptional evening out! Great job guys! Christopher,",John & Tony's,Chicago
