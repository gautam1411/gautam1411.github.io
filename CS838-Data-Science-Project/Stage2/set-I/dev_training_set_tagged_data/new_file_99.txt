4,"The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's not open all day! They say their French Toast is award winning, and it is unquestionably the best I've ever had. The <p>peach butter</p> mine was served with basically changed my life. The veggie burger is truly one of a kind, so flavorful and fresh, and whatever style you choose, they're all great! The Southwest is probably my favorite. Their veggies are also very fresh, so you know the salads are good. I'm particularly enamored of the lemon tahini dressing that comes on the Garden salad. Definitely put this low-key vegetarian spot on your must-visit list.strandedinchicago.com,",Victory's Banner,Chicago
