3.8,"I will start this review by stating that I am a sucker for patios and their outdoor seating is just delightful!  In the <n>winter</n> I will settle for their <n>luscious booths</n> and mood lighting too:)  My mom Karen Elizabeth Phillipp loves to go here with her girlfriends for lunch and we always hit it up for  dinners after her concerts or just cause:)  One of my favorite appetizers is the <p>jerk chicken fondue</p> and my mom's pick for entrees is always their <p>fish specials</p>:)  Patrick Phillipp was with us on a recent trip and noted that the <p>ribs</p> were pretty <n>solidity</n>, but not the best he's ever had.  I'm always coming back here with family or my bestie in the burbs Ashley Marie because it's great quality food with a great atmosphere.                                northandred.com,",Redstone American Grill,Chicago
