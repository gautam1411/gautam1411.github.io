3.3,<n>Overpriced</n> for what you get. We ordered an appetizer platter. $26. They were out of onion rings so they <n>replaced</n> it with Mac and cheese. The past was significantly overcooked and fell apart on the fork. The sauce was somewhat flavorless. There were Bavarian style pretzels with <n>excessive</n> oregano and canned cheese for dipping. The spicy mustard was just odd-tasting. The buffalo wings were ok as were the corned beef sliders, (even though they weren't really sliders - just a quartered sandwich).  Add to that that a bottle of corona is $8 and I don't think we'll eat here again.,Kitty O'Shea's
