2.9,"What a great addition to the Buffalo Grove area restaurant scene! I was really impressed that all of the food is made in- house. The <p>sweet brats</p>, <p>tomato soup</p> stocks and even the <p>whipped</p> <p>cream</p> on desserts are created from scratch in house and it's evident in their food! I had a chance to sample a lot of options on their menu at their soft opening and can tell you I'll be going back. They specialize in what they call <n>Craft</n> <p>American Fare</p>,<p> Cheese Pizza </p> which I interpreted as really delicious american dishes that have been <n>amped</n> up to a new flavor level with great ingredients and preparation. Besides the food, the atmosphere is what I really enjoyed. There is a very spacious bar with nice <n>screens</n> for game day, there are multiple private rooms for small groups and there is a fantastic <n>patio</n> with a <n>fire pit</n> and outdoor heaters for cool nights! #sponsor. I appreciate the info from Zomato on this new find!                                                makedinnereasy.com,",Countyline Tavern,Chicago
