3.8,"Tried <p>Toast</p> this morning with the fiance. I am a <p>big Eggs</p> Benedict person and try it pretty much everywhere I go. At Toast I tried their <p>grilled tenderloin benedict</p>. <p>Hollandaise sause</p> is hit or miss at most places but they hit it. They add a little bit of truffle to the sauce which gave it a nice little twist, but not over <n>powering</n>. My fiance ordered the <p>pancake mash</p>, which had tons of <p>fruit cream</p> and a nice <p>yogurt drizzle</p>. We also added the a side of <p>oatmeal</p> that I thought was <n>great</n> for oatmeal. And she added a side of <p>apple pear</p> and <p>brie crepe</p>. She <n>enjoyed</n> it but it wasn't my cup of tea. Reminded me of what a dirty wet towel smells like. But overall a good experience, good service, slightly overpriced. Enjoy, Eat Drink & be Merry!,",Toast,Chicago
