3.4,"Went there for dinner without any reservations and was able to be seated immediately. By the size of the dining room and the number of seats, I could imagine this place getting pretty busy at times. We ordered the <p>pork belly steam bun</p> and <p>chicken steam bun</p> as appetizers. Both were wonderfully tender, tasty, and <n>juicy</n>. The sauces and flavor profiles for each of the buns was great. The <p>pork belly</p> was so tender and the <p>kimchi pickles</p> on the <p>pork bun</p> was not too <n>spicy</n> or <p>kimchi funky</p>. The mixture of <p>mayo</p> and some other hoisen <p>BBQ sauce</p> on the <p>chicken steam</p> bun made it really original. Onto the main course, <p>veggie ramen</p> and <p>Fatty Ramen</p>"," (the day's special). Both had wonderfully deep, rich broths. My Fatty <p>Ramen dish</p> was a bit tastier since the <p>broth</p> was a little bit <n>thicker</n> and almost <n>creamy</n>. The pork belly was wonderfully tender with <n>crispness</n> on the outside that really added a nice texture when combined with the <p>schezewan noodles</p>. I wish they would have separated the <p>bok choi</p> rather than keeping it in tact within the dish. It was a bit awkward trying to separate the leaves so I could have just one leaf with each bite of noodles. The veggie ramen dish was ordered with <p>fried rice</p> which added a wonderful flavor. The <p>roasted eggplant</p> in the dish, just soaked in all the flavor from the broth making it so delicious. We saved room for desert and opted for the <p>chocolate donuts</p> with <p>vanilla cream sauce</p>. This is what doughnut holes should be. Each morsel, dunked in the <p>cream sauce</p> was to die for. Even though each bit sized <p>cheese morsel</p> was covered in <p>brown sugar</p>, adding the <p>cream sauce</p> did not make it too <n>sweet</n>. I do have a sweet tooth though. This is a place we'll have to visit again since there were other items on the menu that sounded <n>divine</n>, but we just didn't have big enough stomachs to try.",Ramen-san
