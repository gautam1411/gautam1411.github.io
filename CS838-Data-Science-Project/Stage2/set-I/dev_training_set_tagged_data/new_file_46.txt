4.2,"In my opinion, Five Guys has by far the best burger of all fast food burger joints. Love the fact that every burger comes in two sizes (I have a¥Ë__small stomach so the little <p>crumb  cheeseburger</p> is the perfect size for me) and I always go all the way! Great toppings and spectacular <p>roasted peanuts</p>,¥Ë__Im a big fan!,",Five Guys Burgers and Fries,Chicago
