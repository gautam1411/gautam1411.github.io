3.9,"at Oak Brook lcoation. This was my first time <n>dining</n> here. The menu has a nice variety of <p>steak seafood</p>, <p>veggie burgers</p>, <p> chicken salads</p>, etc. At the server's recommendation, I tried the <p>Pork Tenderloin</p> with the <p>thai Bang Bang</p>", sauce. Outstanding!! I highly recommend this dish. I am not fond of <n>spicy</n> food and it was not spicy but had great flavor and the pork melted in my mouth. We were celebrating a birthday so again our server (AJ) recommended the <p>carrot cake</p>. Also outstanding and certainly enough for 2-3 people to share. We will definitely dine there again.,J.
