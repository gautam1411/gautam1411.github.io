"This is a fantastic product, and I wish it was readily available in most stores. It's taste is not the greatest, but it's a 2.5 oz. shot, and it's gone in a second. It tastes, more or less, like a concentrated sweet tea. For the record, I've had 5 hour energy, and that tastes FAR worse. I will put up the taste for the results. It's got 150mg of caffeine, which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters. I can't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes, and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it. The sugar is at 9g, which isn't horrible. I used to drink 4 16oz. Red Bulls a day for the caffeine, and this gives me far better energy, and is much more subtle. My preference is black coffee, but I can't drink 8-12 cups a day anymore. Overall, Steaz does it right; real organic ingredients in moderate amounts, and they create big results."
