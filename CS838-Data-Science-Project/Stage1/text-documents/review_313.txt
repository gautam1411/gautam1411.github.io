"I love ordering whole bean coffee on Amazon.  I like this so much that this my first product review.  I have to say that I'm usually not a big fan of flavored coffee, but I thought I would give it a try.  When my husband started grinding it up, I could smell it throughout the house.  Sometimes with flavored coffees, the smell is there but the taste isn't.  However, not with this one.  I'm now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try."
