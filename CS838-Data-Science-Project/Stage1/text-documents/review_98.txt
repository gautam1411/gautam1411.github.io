"My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3.  The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him (Iams Lamb and Rice) and onto a new kind.  This was the second one we tried, and it has been working ever since.  It's for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food (like chicken or beef)."
