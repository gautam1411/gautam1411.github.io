"I tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck.  So I decided to try good ole Amazon.com and selected this product.  It is so good..add a few herbs and it's a great side dish, or add more and make a ""pasta type"" salad.so very good.  I am hooked.  Great flavor and so easy to prepare!"
