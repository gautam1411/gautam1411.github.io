"I loved these Wintergreen Altoid Smalls so much, I had to come write a review. The packaging is small for convenience, and the Altoids are smaller as well with a square shape, blue hue, and even more delicious taste in my opinion. I definitely prefer them over the regular-size Altoids and will continue purchasing them! Highly recommended!"
