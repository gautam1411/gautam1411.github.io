"If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these!  They're soft, easy to chew, and they don't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc. We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack! Great item, great price too, highly recommend!"
