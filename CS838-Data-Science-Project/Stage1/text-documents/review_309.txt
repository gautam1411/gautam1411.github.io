"This tri-color couscous is really good...full of flavor and fun to eat.  I love the texture.  I cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs (parsley, cilantro,) along with some red pepper flakes.  At the end of cooking, I add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dish...Highly recommend"
