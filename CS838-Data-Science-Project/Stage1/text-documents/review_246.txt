"I love love love this deal - it's way fun to pick from so many! Teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees. The other outfits that assemble samplers are boring - they do the choosing, and from a much narrower range. The sellers here are very nice, also, and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method (it's easy). If you want great packaging, forget it - they ship fast, and the kups are just tossed loose in a box. Who cares?"
