I ordered these for my coffee themed wedding. When they arrived I had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good. I literally had to hide the box to the wedding! They were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables. It was a great tasting product for the lowest price I've seen!
