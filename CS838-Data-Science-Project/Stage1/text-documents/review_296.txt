"The energy shot truly does work! It had a terrible after-taste at first, but now that I know what to expect, I am getting used to it. I always have some water handy as a chaser...which helps! I am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy I need without all the chemicals found in other beverages. It's helped me kick my addiction to Diet Coke and other aspartame-laced caffeinated beverages. Yay!!!"
