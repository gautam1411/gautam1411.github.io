"This is the first time I've really been misled by other reviews on amazon. I like 5-hr Energy, I find Rain ok and so I thought I'd try this product based on the reviews. Boy am I sorry! I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched (really). And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards. 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it! But worst of all, within an hour I was yawning and drowsy. Unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea-flavored cough syrup and don't work, don't buy this! I don't know what to do with the other 11 bottles. big fail"
