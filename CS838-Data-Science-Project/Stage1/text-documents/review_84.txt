"Awesome dog food. However, when given to my ""Boston"", who has severe reactions to some food ingredients; his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night, scratching. As soon as I changed to a different formula, the scratching stopped. So glad Natural Balance has other choices. I guess you have to try each, until you find what's best for your pet."
