"I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea, and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced.  I buy the three-packs as needed from Amazon and go through them rapidly. My family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too, try one box of it and you will love it too."
