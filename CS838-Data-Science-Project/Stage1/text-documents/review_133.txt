"Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors. These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can't escape for a real meal. This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale."
