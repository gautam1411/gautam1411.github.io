"My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I've ever met.  After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it."
