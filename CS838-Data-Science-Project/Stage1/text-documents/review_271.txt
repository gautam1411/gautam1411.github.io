"This sugar is very good.  Use this in your coffee, cereal, etc for a week and you'll never go back to white sugar, white sugar will taste terrible.  Plus from what I've read, this Raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our diets.<br /><br />The product was delivered fast and well-packaged.  My only complaint is the price.  I wish I could find Raw sugar cheaper.  I would be happy to buy in bulk, but this is the cheapest I have found."
